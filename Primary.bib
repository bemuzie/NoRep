  abstract = {Pulmonary nodules were modelled with Perspex rods of various diameters. Computed tomographic (CT) images of these rods were obtained in the centre of the scan field, both in air and in a water bath. The numerical values at the centres of the rods were compared with values obtained from scan simulations that isolated the effects of the filtered backprojection. Both real scan and simulated data were reconstructed with different algorithms. Air was found to give markedly depressed attenuation values in real scans, but not in the simulations. This effect was considered to be the result of smoothing or inappropriate beam hardening corrections. In the simulated data, air resulted in elevated attenuation values due to overshoot of the point spread function. Such overshoots varied with object size and had a more extensive influence than could be appreciated from the real scan data. Different algorithms produced different central attenuation values as a result of differing overshoot effects. These and other artifact influences make attenuation measurements taken from CT images unreliable for the assessment of pulmonary nodules. Area measurements made over a period of time may more reliably discriminate between benign and malignant nodules.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the detection rates of pulmonary nodules on CT as a function of slab thickness using sliding thin-slab maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering (VR).
Eighty-eight oncology patients (33 women, 55 men; mean age, 59 years; age range, 18-81 years) who routinely underwent chest CT examinations were prospectively included. Two radiologists independently evaluated each CT examination for the presence of pulmonary nodules using MIP and VR, with each image reconstructed using three different slab thicknesses (5, 8, 11 mm). The standard of reference was the maximum number of detected nodules, which were classified by localization and size, judged to be true-positives by a consensus panel. Interreader agreement was assessed by kappa value on a nodule-by-nodule basis. Sensitivities for both reconstruction techniques and for the three slab thicknesses were calculated using the proportion procedure for survey data with the patient as the primary sample unit and were compared using the Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni correction for both readers separately.
One thousand fifty-eight true-positive nodules were detected. Interreader agreement was fair to moderate. Sensitivity for pulmonary nodules was superior for 8-mm MIP (reader 1, 84\%; reader 2, 81\%) and was significantly better than the sensitivities of all other tested techniques for both readers (p $<$ 0.001 each) independent of nodule localization and size (except for one reader's analysis of 8-mm MIP versus 11-mm MIP for nodules $>$ 8 mm). A higher sensitivity was achieved using MIP than VR.
MIP with a slab thickness of 8 mm is superior in the detection of pulmonary nodules to all other tested techniques.},

Two series of baseline CT screenings in high-risk people were retrospectively reviewed. The first series (n = 1,000) was performed in 1993-1998; the second (n = 1,897), in 1999-2002. In each series, cases in which the largest noncalcified nodule detected was less than 5.0 mm in diameter and those in which it was 5.0-9 mm were reviewed to determine whether diagnostic work-up prior to first annual repeat screening showed or would have shown nodule growth and led or would have led to a diagnosis based on biopsy or surgical specimens.
The frequency with which malignancy was or could have been diagnosed when the largest noncalcified nodule was less than 5.0 mm in diameter was 0 of 378, whereas when the largest noncalcified nodule was 5.0-9 mm in diameter, the frequency was 13 or 14 of 238. If persons with only nodules smaller than 5.0 mm had merely been referred for first annual repeat screening without immediate further work-up, the referrals for such work-up would have been reduced by 54\% (from 817 [28\%] to 385 [13\%] of 2,897).
In modern CT screening for lung cancer at baseline, detected noncalcified nodules smaller than 5.0 mm in diameter do not justify immediate work-up but only annual repeat screening to determine whether interim growth has occurred.},

Lung segmentation is a requisite preprocessing step for most CAD schemes. This paper proposes a parameter-free lung segmentation algorithm with the aim of improving lung nodule detection accuracy, focusing on juxtapleural nodules. A bidirectional chain coding method combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to selectively smooth the lung border while minimizing the over-segmentation of adjacent regions. This automated method was tested on 233 computed tomography (CT) studies from the lung imaging database consortium (LIDC), representing 403 juxtapleural nodules. The approach obtained a 92.6\% re-inclusion rate. Segmentation accuracy was further validated on 10 randomly selected CT series, finding a 0.3\% average over-segmentation ratio and 2.4\% under-segmentation rate when compared to manually segmented reference standards done by an expert.},

In a lung cancer screening trial, 188 baseline nodules $>$5 mm were identified. Including follow-ups, these nodules formed a study-set of 545 nodules. Nodules were independently double read by two readers using commercially available volumetry software. The software offers readers three different analysing algorithms. We compared the inter-observer variability of nodule volumetry when the readers used the same and different algorithms.
Both readers were able to correctly segment and measure 72\% of nodules. In 80\% of these cases, the readers chose the same algorithm. When readers used the same algorithm, exactly the same volume was measured in 50\% of readings and a difference of $>$25\% was observed in 4\%. When the readers used different algorithms, 83\% of measurements showed a difference of $>$25\%.
Modern volumetric software failed to correctly segment a high number of screen detected nodules. While choosing a different algorithm can yield better segmentation of a lung nodule, reproducibility of volumetric measurements deteriorates substantially when different algorithms were used. It is crucial even in the same software package to choose identical parameters for follow-up.},

  abstract = {While visual assessment is the simplest way to evaluate positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), faintly positive nodules are often difficult to evaluate. We performed visual and semiquantitative analyses of pulmonary nodules from 1 to 3 cm in size to determine the optimal method of analysis for PET data, especially for faintly positive nodules on visual assessment.
Positron emission tomography data were analyzed for 161 pulmonary nodules from 1 to 3 cm in size (108 malignant and 53 benign nodules). On visual assessment, FDG uptake by the nodules was classified into three grades in comparison with mediastinal blood pool, (ie, definitely positive, faintly positive, and negative). In addition, FDG uptake was measured by the standard uptake value (SUV), the contrast ratio to the contralateral lung (CR-lung), and the contrast ratio to the cerebellum (CR-brain). Cut-off values for each variable were determined from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and the values were 2.5 for the SUV, 0.4 for the CR-lung, and 0.25 for the CR-brain. Nodules with FDG uptake above these cut-off values were defined as positive in each method.
Visual assessment showed definitely positive for 80 nodules (64 malignant and 16 benign), faintly positive for 22 (17 malignant and 5 benign), and negative for 59 nodules (27 malignant and 32 benign). In the 139 nodules that were definitely positive or negative by visual assessment, there were no significant differences of sensitivity and specificity among the four methods (visual assessment, SUV, CR-lung, and CR-brain). In the 17 malignant nodules that were faintly positive, the SUV did not detect any true-positive nodules, but the CR-lung and CR-brain showed 9 and 5 true-positive nodules, respectively, resulting in a significantly higher sensitivity than the SUV (p $<$ 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). Fifteen of 17 faintly positive malignant nodules (88\%) were histologically well- or moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The semiquantitative methods (SUV, CR-lung, and CR-brain) do not improve the efficacy of visual assessment alone for nodules graded as definitely positive or negative. However, faintly positive nodules on visual assessment should be evaluated by the CR-lung or CR-brain rather than the SUV, and are often differentiated adenocarcinomas.},

High-resolution imaging studies on large cohorts of patients generate vast data sets, which are infeasible to analyze through manual interpretation. In this article we describe a comprehensive architecture for computer-aided detection (CAD) and surveillance on lung nodules in CT images. Central to this architecture are the analytic components: an automated nodule detection system, nodule tracking capabilities and volume measurement, which are integrated within a data management system that includes mechanisms for receiving and archiving images, a database for storing quantitative nodule measurements and visualization, and reporting tools. We describe two studies to evaluate CAD technology within this architecture, and the potential application in large clinical trials. The first study involves performance assessment of an automated nodule detection system and its ability to increase radiologist sensitivity when used to provide a second opinion. The second study investigates nodule volume measurements on CT made using a semi-automated technique and shows that volumetric analysis yields significantly different tumor response classifications than a 2D diameter approach. These studies demonstrate the potential of automated CAD tools to assist in quantitative image analysis for clinical trials.},

Fifty-nine subsolid nodules in 58 patients were evaluated. The maximum diameters of subsolid nodules and the solid component on CT were measured by two radiologists in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) planes using in-house software. In addition, the maximum diameters of the tumor and invasive component were measured on pathology by two pathologists. CT measurements were compared with pathologic measurements.
There was a strong correlation between the size of the solid component on CT and invasive component on pathology, as well as the size of subsolid nodules and the tumor size (r = 0.82-0.87 for 3D measurement, 0.72-0.88 for 2D measurement; p $<$ 0.0001). The size of subsolid nodules in 3D and 2D measurements was significantly larger than tumor size (p $<$ 0.0001). In regard to measurement of the solid component, 3D measurements tended to be larger than the size of the invasive component whereas 2D measurement tended to be similar to the size of the invasive component. By applying a size criteria of solid component that was 3 mm or lesser in maximum diameter, preinvasive and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma was predicted with a specificity of 100\% (28 of 28).
We found a significant correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section CT and the invasive component on pathology.},

Eighty-five patients (48 males and 37 females, mean age 57 years, range 34-78 years) were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy for the purpose of differential diagnosis of SPNs (size between 1 and 4 cm). Images of all patients were evaluated visually in a prospective manner.
Positive scintigraphic results were found in 37 out of 40 (93\%) patients with malignant SPNs including 34 out of 35 (97\%) patients with primary lung carcinoma. Two remaining false negative cases turned out to be metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma and leiomyosarcoma. Among 45 benign tumours, negative results were obtained in 31 cases (69\%) and positive results in 14. The accuracy of the method was 80\%. Analysis of the results of the visual assessment of scintigrams revealed a significantly higher frequency of false positive results among larger nodules (diameter at least 1.4 cm). Uptake of the tracer in those nodules was therefore assessed semi-quantitatively (using the tumour-to-background ratio), in expectation of an improvement in the low specificity of the visual method. The semi-quantitative assessment reduced the total number of false positive results in a subgroup of larger nodules from 13 to six, while preserving the high sensitivity of the method.
The combination of visual analysis (for lesions smaller than 1.4 cm in diameter) and semi-quantitative assessment (for larger lesions) provided a high sensitivity of the method and significantly improved its specificity (84\%) and accuracy (88\%) in comparison with visual analysis (p$<$0.05).},

CT scans were performed on a chest phantom containing various nodules (diameters of 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 mm; +100, -630 and -800 HU for each diameter) at 80, 100, 120 kVp and 10, 20, 50, 100 mAs (a total of 12 radiation dose settings). Each CT was reconstructed using filtered back projection, iDose4, and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). Thereafter, two radiologists measured the diameter and attenuation of the nodules. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of CT images were also obtained. Influence of radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm on measurement error and objective image quality metrics was analyzed using generalized estimating equations.
The 80 kVp, 10 mAs CT scan was not feasible for the measurement of 3 mm sized simulated ground-glass nodule (GGN); otherwise, diameter measurement error was not significantly influenced by radiation dose (P $>$ 0.05). IR did not have a significant impact on diameter measurement error for simulated solid nodules (P $>$ 0.05). However, for simulated GGNs, IMR was associated with significantly decreased relative diameter measurement error (P $<$ 0.001). Attenuation measurement error was not significantly influenced by either radiation dose or reconstruction algorithm (P $>$ 0.05). Objective image quality was significantly better with IMR (P $<$ 0.05).
Nodule measurements were not affected by radiation dose except for 3 mm simulated GGN on 80 kVp, 10 mAs dose setting. However, for GGNs, IMR may help reduce diameter measurement error while improving image quality.},

Artificial ellipsoid-shaped nodules with known sizes were inserted in clinical chest tomosynthesis images. The volume of the nodules corresponded to that of a sphere with a diameter of 4.0, 8.0, or 12.0 mm. Four thoracic radiologists were given the task to determine the longest diameter of the nodules. All nodules were measured twice. Measurement accuracy in terms of the mean measurement error was determined. Intraobserver and interobserver variabilities, as well as variability because of differences between nodules and their locations, were used as measures of precision.
The mean measurement error ranged from -0.3 to 0.1 mm for the nodule size groups and observers. Of the smallest nodules, the observers found 7-17 of total 50 nodules nonmeasurable. The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were of similar magnitude, indicating relatively small differences between the observers. The internodule variability was in general larger, indicating that the different characteristics of the nodules and their location are sources of variability.
The results suggest a high accuracy and precision for manual measurements of the nodules in chest tomosynthesis images. However, small nodules ($<$5.0 mm) may be difficult to measure at all because of poor visibility.},

The correlation between the quantifiable parameters of SPNs volume perfusion imaging derived with 16-slice spiral CT and 64-slice spiral CT and nodules size were assessed by means of linear regression analysis.
No significant correlations were found between the nodules size and each of the peak height (PHSPN) (32.15 Hu+/-14.55 Hu),ratio of peak height of the SPN to that of the aorta (SPN-to-A ratio) (13.20+/-6.18)\%, perfusion (PSPN) (29.79+/-19.12) mLmin(-1)100 g(-1) and mean transit time (12.95+/-6.53) s (r =0.081, P =0.419; r =0.089, P =0.487; r =0.167, P =0.077; r =0.023, P =0.880).
No significant correlations were found between the quantifiable parameters of SPNs volume perfusion imaging derived with 16-slice spiral CT and 64-slice spiral CT and nodules size.},

Two same-day repeat-CT scans of 69 patients (24 men and 45 women) with 69 SSNs were randomly assigned as initial or follow-up scans and were read by the same (situation 1) or different readers (situation 2). SSN size and solid portion size were measured in both situations. Measurement variability was calculated and coefficients of variation were used for comparisons.
Measurement variability for the longest and average diameter of SSNs was ±1.3 mm (±13.0\%) and ±1.3 mm (±14.4\%) in situation 1, and ±2.2 mm (±21.0\%) and ±2.1 mm (±21.3\%) in situation 2, respectively. For solid portion, measurement variability on lung and mediastinal windows was ±1.2 mm (±27.1\%) and ±0.8 mm (±24.0\%) in situation 1, and ±3.7 mm (±61.0\%) and ±1.5 mm (±47.3\%) in situation 2, respectively. There were no significant differences in the degree of variability between the longest and average diameters and between the lung and mediastinal window settings (p$>$0.05). However, measurement variability significantly increased when the follow-up and initial CT readers were different (p$<$0.001).
A cutoff of ±2.2 mm can be reliably used to determine true nodule growth on follow-up CT. Solid portion measurements were not reliable in evaluating SSNs' change when readers of initial and follow-up CT were different.},

Because interobserver variability may lead to inaccurate estimations of nodule growth on repeat radiographic assessment, an incorrect presumption of malignant etiology or misclassification of tumor response to treatment may result. The maximum diameters of 47 pulmonary nodules from 22 dogs and 7 cats were measured. Measurements were performed using one digital thoracic radiographic projection by eight clinicians. The eight clinicians included two interns, two residents, two board-certified veterinary specialists, and two board-certified veterinary radiologists. A mixed-effect analysis of variance model was used to evaluate the contribution of reader, experience level, patient, nodule, and nodule size to the overall variability in mean pulmonary nodule diameter. The interobserver variability in diameter measurement for any given nodule was 16\%, and experience level and nodule size classification did not contribute to measurement variability. Linear measurements of the diameter of a pulmonary nodule can vary significantly among a group of clinicians; however, depending on the criteria used to evaluate nodule growth or tumor response, the 16\% interobserver variability reported here is likely not clinically significant.},

Ten subjects with asthma or chronic bronchitis who had one or more lung nodules were included. For each subject, two sets of CT images were obtained at inspiration and at expiration. A total of 33 nodules (23 nodules $>$ or =3 mm) were identified and their volume measured using a semiautomatic volume measurement program. Differences between nodule volume on inspiration and expiration were compared using the paired t-test. Percent differences, between on inspiration and expiration, in nodule attenuation, total lung volume, whole lung attenuation, and regional lung attenuation, were computed and compared with percent difference in nodule volume determined by linear correlation analysis.
The difference in nodule volume observed between inspiration and expiration was significant (p $<$ 0.01); the mean percent difference in lung nodule volume was 23.1\% for all nodules and for nodules $>$ or =3 mm. The volume of nodules was measured to be larger on expiration CT than on inspiration CT (28 out of 33 nodules; 19 out of 23 nodules $>$ or =3 mm). A statistically significant correlation was found between the percent difference of lung nodule volume and lung volume or regional lung attenuation (p $<$ 0.05) for nodules $>$ or =3 mm.
Volumetric measurements of pulmonary nodules were significantly affected by changes in lung volume. The variability in this respiration-related measurement should be considered to determine whether growth has occurred in a lung nodule.},

  abstract = {Nodule growth as observed in computed tomography (CT) scans acquired at different times is the primary feature to malignancy of indeterminate small lung nodules. In this paper, we propose the estimation of nodule size through a scale-space representation which needs no segmentation and has high intra- and inter-operator reproducibility. Lung nodules usually appear in CT images as blob-like patterns and can be analyzed in the scale-space by Laplacian of Gaussian ( LoG ) kernels. For each nodular pattern the LoG scale-space signature was computed and the related characteristic scale adopted as measurement of nodule size. Both in vitro and in vivo validation of LoG characteristic scale were carried out. In vitro validation was done by 40 nondeformable phantoms and 10 deformable phantoms. A close relationship between the characteristic scale and the equivalent diameter, i.e., the diameter of the sphere having the same volume of nodules, (Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.99) and, for nodules undergoing little deformations (obtained at constant volume), small variability of the characteristic scale was observed. The in vivo validation was performed on low and standard-dose CT scans collected from the ITALUNG screening trial (86 nodules) and from the LIDC public data set (89 solid nodules and 40 part-solid nodules or ground-glass opacities). The Pearson correlation coefficient between characteristic scale and equivalent diameter was 0.83-0.93 for ITALUNG and 0.68-0.83 for LIDC data set. Intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of characteristic scale was excellent: on a set of 40 lung nodules of ITALUNG data, two radiologists produced identical results in repeated measurements. The scan-rescan variability of the characteristic scale was also investigated on 86 two-year-stable solid lung nodules (each one observed, on average, in four CT scans) identified in the ITALUNG screening trial: a coefficient of repeatability of about 0.9 mm was observed. Experimental evidence supports the clinical use of the LoG characteristic scale to measure nodule size in CT imaging.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the effect of coaxial needle size on pneumothorax rate and the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy (TNAB) of pulmonary nodules.
Retrospective review of 846 consecutive CT-guided TNAB procedures was performed. A coaxial approach was implemented in all patients by using an 18- or 19-gauge outer stabilizing needle through which a smaller aspiration needle or automated biopsy gun was inserted for tissue sampling. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze coaxial needle size, age, sex, smoking history, lesion size, use of an automated core biopsy gun, number of needle passes, and frequency of chest tube placement. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated for 676 patients with at least 18 months of clinical follow-up.
Pneumothorax occurred in 226 of 846 patients. Coaxial needle size and patient age had a significant effect on pneumothorax rate. Pneumothorax occurred in 124 (38\%) of 324 patients who underwent procedures with 18-gauge needles and in 121 (23\%) of 522 patients who underwent procedures with 19-gauge needles (P $<$.001). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 96\% for procedures performed with 18-gauge needles and 92\% for procedures performed with 19-gauge needles, with a sensitivity of 95\% and 89\% and a specificity of 100\% and 99\%, respectively. Pneumothorax occurred in 153 patients older than 60 years, in 99 patients 60 years and younger (P $<$.02), in 90 patients older than 70 years, and in 162 patients younger than 70 years (P $<$.01). The relationship between pneumothorax rate and age as a continuous distribution was not significant (P $<$.07), nor were the 50- or 75-year age cutoffs (P $<$.06 and P $<$.9, respectively).
Use of a smaller coaxial stabilizing needle produces a substantially decreased risk of pneumothorax with comparable diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for histopathologic diagnosis of pulmonary nodules.},

  abstract = {To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability.
The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm(3) nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm(3) were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed.
There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm(3); range, 15.3-499.5 mm(3)). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1\%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9\%); in 16 cases (3.7\%), the discrepancy was larger than 10\%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins.
In a minority (approximately 11\%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess accuracy of lung nodule volumetry in low-dose CT with application of iterative reconstruction (IR) according to nodule size, nodule density and CT tube currents, using artificial lung nodules within an anthropomorphic thoracic phantom.
Eight artificial nodules (four diameters: 5, 8, 10 and 12 mm; two CT densities: -630 HU that represents ground-glass nodule and +100 HU that represents solid nodule) were randomly placed inside a thoracic phantom. Scans were performed with tube current-time product to 10, 20, 30 and 50 mAs. Images were reconstructed with IR and filtered back projection (FBP). We compared volume estimates to a reference standard and calculated the absolute percentage error (APE).
The APE of all nodules was significantly lower when IR was used than with FBP (7.5 ± 4.7\% compared with 9.0 ±6.9\%; p $<$ 0.001). The effect of IR was more pronounced for smaller nodules (p $<$ 0.001). IR showed a significantly lower APE than FBP in ground-glass nodules (p $<$ 0.0001), and the difference was more pronounced at the lowest tube current (11.8 ± 5.9\% compared with 21.3 ± 6.1\%; p $<$ 0.0001). The effect of IR was most pronounced for ground-glass nodules in the lowest CT tube current.
Lung nodule volumetry in low-dose CT by application of IR showed reliable accuracy in a phantom study. Lung nodule volumetry can be reliably applicable to all lung nodules including small, ground-glass nodules even in ultra-low-dose CT with application of IR.
IR significantly improved the accuracy of lung nodule volumetry compared with FBP particularly for ground-glass (-630 HU) nodules. Volumetry in low-dose CT can be utilized in patient with lung nodule work-up, and IR has benefit for small, ground-glass lung nodules in low-dose CT.},

The long-axis diameters and 3D volumes of lung tumours were measured using CAV by two chest radiologists for 71 consecutive patients with peripheral lung cancer who underwent at least two CT examinations before surgical resection. We evaluated the inter-observer variability for the ratio of diameter change (RCdiameter) and volume change (RCvolume), which were based on two CT images obtained at different times prior to resection. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated by Bland-Altman plots. Based on the volumes obtained from 3D-CAV, we calculated the DTs and compared DT differences between solid, PS and NS types of lung tumours.
The inter-observer Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were 0.87 for RCvolume and 0.64 for RCdiameter (p $<$ 0.001). For all internal appearance types, the rs values for RCvolume were greater than those for RCdiameter. The median DT values for solid, PS and NS were 278, 347 and 584 days, respectively. NS- and PS-type tumours had significantly longer DTs (p = 0.024; by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).
DT determinations using 3D-CAV had good correlations with the internal appearances of lung cancers. Lung tumour volume measurements by 3D-CAV exhibited better inter-observer correlations than did diameter measurements.},

Screening participants of the NELSON study underwent low-dose CT. For indeterminate nodules (volume 50-500 mm(3)), follow-up CT was performed 3 months after baseline. A negative baseline screen resulted in a regular second-round examination 1 year later. Subjects referred to a pulmonologist because of a fast-growing (VDT $<$400 days) solid nodule in the baseline or regular second round were included in this study. Histology was the reference for diagnosis, or stability on subsequent CTs, confirming benignity. Mean follow-up of non-resected nodules was 4.4 years. Optimisation of the false-positive rate was evaluated at maintained sensitivity for lung cancer diagnosis with VDT $<$400 days as reference.
Sixty-eight fast-growing nodules were included; 40 \% were malignant. The optimal VDT cutoff for the 3-month follow-up CT after baseline was 232 days. This cutoff reduced false-positive referrals by 33 \% (20 versus 30). For the regular second round, VDTs varied more among malignant nodules, precluding lowering of the VDT cutoff of 400 days.
All malignant fast-growing lung nodules referred after the 3-month follow-up CT in the baseline lung cancer screening round had VDT ≤232 days. Lowering the VDT cutoff may reduce false-positive referrals.
• Lung nodules are common in CT lung cancer screening, most being benign • Short-term follow-up CT can identify fast-growing intermediate-size lung nodules • Most fast-growing nodules on short-term follow-up CT still prove to be benign • A new volume-doubling time (VDT) cut-off is proposed for lung screening • The optimised VDT cutoff may decrease false-positive case referrals for lung cancer.},

  abstract = {To retrospectively assess volume measurement variability in solid pulmonary nodules (volume, 15-500 mm(3)) detected at lung cancer screening and to quantify the independent effects of nodule morphology, size, and location.
This retrospective study was a substudy of the screening program that was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health, and all participants provided written informed consent. Two independent readers used semiautomated software to measure the volume of pulmonary nodules detected in 6774 participants aged 50-75 years (5917 men). Nodules were classified according to their location (purely intraparenchymal, pleural based, juxtavascular, or fissure attached), morphology (smooth, polylobulated, spiculated, or irregular), and size ($<$or=50 mm(3) or $>$50 mm(3)). The level of agreement was expressed by using the absolute values of the relative volume differences (RVDs). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs) were computed to quantify the independent effects of morphology, location, and size on RVD categories.
Altogether, 4225 nodules in 2239 participants were included. Complete agreement in volume was obtained for 3646 (86\%) of the nodules. Disagreement was small (absolute value of RVD $<$ 5\%) for 173 (4\%) nodules, moderate (absolute value of RVD $>$or= 5\% but $<$ 15\%) for 232 (6\%), and large (absolute value of RVD $>$or= 15\%) for 174 (4\%). Multivariate analysis showed that the ORs of volume disagreement were 15.7, 3.1, and 1.9 for irregular, spiculated, and polylobulated nodules, respectively; 3.5, 2.6, and 2.1 for juxtavascular, pleural-based, and fissure-attached nodules, respectively; and 1.3 for large nodules compared with smooth, purely intraparenchymal, and small reference nodules.
Nodule morphology, location, and size influence volume measurement variability, particularly for juxtavascular and irregular nodules.},

PET and DWI were carried out on 87 pulmonary nodules measuring from 1 to 3 cm in size (66 NSCLCs and 21 benign nodules). The signal intensity (SI) of DWI was measured by the contrast ratio (CR) between the lesions and spinal cord, i.e., SI-CR. The maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of PET was measured by CR between the lesions and contralateral lung, i.e., SUV-CR.
DWI and PET showed sensitivities of 0.86 and 0.71, and specificities of 0.90 and 0.81, respectively. While there was no significant difference in the specificity between the two, DWI showed a significantly higher sensitivity than PET (p = 0.013). While the difference in the sensitivity was significant in lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.012), there was no difference in the other histological types. Both the SI-CR and SUV-CR were significantly higher in the tumors with either histological invasiveness or lymphatic metastasis than in those without.
DWI is thus considered to be useful, not only to diagnose NSCLCs, especially in lung adenocarcinoma, but also for predicting tumor aggressiveness as well as FDG-PET.},

A total of 151 pulmonary nodules (diameter 2.2-20.5 mm, mean diameter 7.4+/-4.5 mm) in ten subjects with pulmonary metastases were examined with low-dose four-detector-row CT (120 kVp, 20 mAs (effective), collimation 4x1 mm, normalized pitch 1.75, slice thickness 1.25 mm, reconstruction increment 0.8 mm; Somatom VolumeZoom, Siemens). Two consecutive low-dose scans covering the whole lung were performed within 10 min. Nodule volume was determined for all pulmonary nodules visually detected in both scans using the volumetry tool included in the Siemens LungCare software. The 95\% limits of agreement between nodule volume measurements on different scans were calculated using the Bland and Altman method for assessing measurement agreement. Intra- and interobserver agreement of volume measurement were determined using repetitive measurements of 50 randomly selected nodules at the same scan by the same and different observers. Taking into account all 151 nodules, 95\% limits of agreement were -20.4 to 21.9\% (standard error 1.5\%); they were -19.3 to 20.4\% (standard error 1.7\%) for 105 nodules $<$10 mm. Limits of agreement were -3.9 to 5.7\% for intraobserver and -5.5 to 6.6\% for interobserver agreement. Precision of in vivo volumetric analysis of nodules with an automatic volumetry software tool was sufficiently high to allow for detection of clinically relevant growth in small pulmonary nodules.},

  abstract = {There have been several reports on MRI concerning the differential diagnosis of lung nodules by the measurement of relaxation time. Measuring the relaxation time has been reported to be of little value because of a lack of reliability in differentiating nodules, and may vary according to environmental effects such as tumor size, location and physical constitution as seen on CT. From this point of view, we have newly devised a phantom of the thorax containing simulated lung nodules in order to evaluate the environmental effects on the relaxation time, and investigated the fluctuation of the T1 and T2 values of lung nodules of the phantom. The experimental study using simulated lung nodules revealed that T1 and T2 values of the lung nodules shift according to various environmental factors such as tumor size, location, and blood flow. It is concluded that there are definite environmental effects on MRI measurements as seen on CT. In clinical studies with patients showing nodular shadows on chest radiography, we calculated the T1 and T2 relaxation times of lung nodules pre- and post-operatively. The T1 and T2 relaxation times of resected tumors were measured approximately 2 hours after surgery. There was a tendency for the T1 values to decrease and T2 values to increase when compared to preoperative conditions. However it could not be proved that the changes of the relaxation times were solely due to environmental effects, because there were lots of valid causes which affect remained such as loss of blood flow and tissue degeneration after surgery.},

Most small pulmonary nodules are benign, however, and currently the growth rate of the nodule provides for one of the most accurate noninvasive methods of determining malignancy. In this paper, we present methods for measuring the change in nodule size from two computed tomography image scans recorded at different times; from this size change the growth rate may be established. The impact of partial voxels for small nodules is evaluated and isotropic resampling is shown to improve measurement accuracy. Methods for nodule location and sizing, pleural segmentation, adaptive thresholding, image registration, and knowledge-based shape matching are presented. The latter three techniques provide for a significant improvement in volume change measurement accuracy by considering both image scans simultaneously. Improvements in segmentation are evaluated by measuring volume changes in benign or slow growing nodules. In the analysis of 50 nodules, the variance in percent volume change was reduced from 11.54\% to 9.35\% (p = 0.03) through the use of registration, adaptive thresholding, and knowledge-based shape matching.},

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and localized ROC (LROC) analysis of clinical images was performed using the standard digital image database of the Japanese Radiation Technology Society. A total of 30 images with and 20 images without nodule samples were extracted randomly from the database and used for ROC analysis. A total of 100 images were prepared for observation of reduced and nonreduced images. Observers' viewing images were adjusted as nonreduced size (large, 30 x 30 cm) and reduced size (small, 15 x 15 cm).
The estimated mean areas under the LROC curves were 0.665 +/- 0.071 for large-size images and 0.669 +/- 0.087 for small-size images. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (P = .823). The viewing time of small-size images (1201.4 seconds) was significantly shorter than that of large-size images (1719.7 seconds). A statistically significant difference was also found in viewing times between reduced and nonreduced digital images with Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (P $<$ .05).
This study provided important information that there was a statistically significant difference in viewing times between reduced and nonreduced digital chest radiographic images, whereas no significant difference was found in areas under the LROC curves for the accuracy of diagnosis between the two groups. However, the double-check method for chest x-ray screening would be done efficiently by changing the viewing size to improve the specificity of diagnosis.},

Postprocessing tools with automated detection, segmentation, and volumetric analysis of lung nodules may expedite radiological processes and give additional confidence to the radiologists.
To compare two different postprocessing software algorithms (LMS Lung, Median Technologies; LungCARE®, Siemens) in CT volumetric measurement and to analyze the effect of soft (B30) and hard reconstruction filter (B70) on automated volume measurement.
Between January 2010 and April 2010, 45 patients with a total of 113 pulmonary nodules were included. The CT exam was performed on a 64-row multidetector CT scanner (Somatom Sensation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with the following parameters: collimation, 24x1.2 mm; pitch, 1.15; voltage, 120 kVp; reference tube current-time, 100 mAs. Automated volumetric measurement of each lung nodule was performed with the two different postprocessing algorithms based on two reconstruction filters (B30 and B70). The average relative volume measurement difference (VME\%) and the limits of agreement between two methods were used for comparison.
At soft reconstruction filters the LMS system produced mean nodule volumes that were 34.1\% (P $<$ 0.0001) larger than those by LungCARE® system. The VME\% was 42.2\% with a limit of agreement between -53.9\% and 138.4\%.The volume measurement with soft filters (B30) was significantly larger than with hard filters (B70); 11.2\% for LMS and 1.6\% for LungCARE®, respectively (both with P $<$ 0.05). LMS measured greater volumes with both filters, 13.6\% for soft and 3.8\% for hard filters, respectively (P $<$ 0.01 and P $>$ 0.05).
There is a substantial inter-software (LMS/LungCARE®) as well as intra-software variability (B30/B70) in lung nodule volume measurement; therefore, it is mandatory to use the same equipment with the same reconstruction filter for the follow-up of lung nodule volume.},

CT scans including unenhanced and enhanced phases (slice thickness 0.625 and 1.25mm, respectively) for 53 adenocarcinomas presenting as PSNs in 50 patients were retrospectively evaluated. For each nodule, semi-automatic segmentation provided the diameter, mean attenuation, mass, and volume of a whole nodule and its solid component. Interscan variability and statistical significance of the differences in those measures according to the adenocarcinoma category were evaluated by one reader.
All parameters except for the mean attenuation of the solid components, were significantly increased on enhanced CT (p$<$0.05). For the whole nodule, the mean relative differences were as follows: the longest diameter, 1.4\% (limits of agreement, -6.2-9.1); volume, 2.4\% (-26.7-31.4); mass, 7.0\% (-11.3-25.2); mean attenuation, 2.7\% (-5.6-11). For the nodule's solid component, those differences were as follow: the longest diameter, 6.9\% (-34.4-48.2); volume, 17.9\% (-77.8-113.7); mass, 18.8\% (-77.8-115.4). The differences of measures between the unenhanced and enhanced CT were not significantly different between two groups of adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinomas and invasive adenocarcinomas (p$>$0.05).
As most volumetric and attenuation measurements changed significantly after contrast enhancement, care should be taken in comparing unenhanced and enhanced CT in the evaluation of PSNs.},

This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained. From November 2011 to June 2012, 73 patients (26 men and 47 women) with 94 GGNs ($>$5 mm and $<$20 mm; 72 pure and 22 part-solid GGNs) were prospectively enrolled and underwent two consecutive computed tomographic (CT) examinations. Both the volume and mass of GGNs were measured with volumetric software by two radiologists. Intraobserver, interobserver, and interscan variability were analyzed and compared by using the Bland-Altman method and coefficients of variation. The influence of the solid portion of GGNs and GGN size on interscan variability was investigated with multiple linear regression analysis and analysis of variance.
Nodule segmentation was successful in 420 of 438 (95.9\%) segmentations. As for volume measurement, interscan variability ranged from -17.3\% to 18.5\%, while intraobserver and interobserver variability ranged from -7.6\% to 8.5\% and from -11.7\% to 18.1\%, respectively. Interscan variability in mass measurement ranged from -17.7\% to 18.6\%, while intraobserver and interobserver variability ranged from -8.4\% to 9.4\% and from -17.5\% to 11.8\%, respectively. In the coefficient of variation comparison, there were no significant differences in volume and mass measurements for intraobserver, interscan, and interobserver variability. Measurement variability of volume and mass was not significantly influenced by the presence of a solid portion, solid portion size, or GGN size.
Mass measurement of GGNs showed measurement variability from -17.7\% to 18.6\% and may be a useful method in the follow-up of GGNs with solid portions less than or equal to 5 mm.},

The goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-institutional effort to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of nodule borders and volume estimate bias of computerized segmentation algorithms in CT images of lung cancer, and to provide results from such a study. The dataset used for this evaluation consisted of 52 tumors in 41 CT volumes (40 patient datasets and 1 dataset containing scans of 12 phantom nodules of known volume) from five collections available in The Cancer Imaging Archive. Three academic institutions developing lung nodule segmentation algorithms submitted results for three repeat runs for each of the nodules. We compared the performance of lung nodule segmentation algorithms by assessing several measurements of spatial overlap and volume measurement. Nodule sizes varied from 29 μl to 66 ml and demonstrated a diversity of shapes. Agreement in spatial overlap of segmentations was significantly higher for multiple runs of the same algorithm than between segmentations generated by different algorithms (p $<$ 0.05) and was significantly higher on the phantom dataset compared to the other datasets (p $<$ 0.05). Algorithms differed significantly in the bias of the measured volumes of the phantom nodules (p $<$ 0.05) underscoring the need for assessing performance on clinical data in addition to phantoms. Algorithms that most accurately estimated nodule volumes were not the most repeatable, emphasizing the need to evaluate both their accuracy and precision. There were considerable differences between algorithms, especially in a subset of heterogeneous nodules, underscoring the recommendation that the same software be used at all time points in longitudinal studies.},

  abstract = {In lung cancer screening, benign and malignant nodules can be classified through nodule growth assessment by the registration and, then, subtraction between follow-up computed tomography scans. During the registration, the volume of nodule regions in the floating image should be preserved, whereas the volume of other regions in the floating image should be aligned to that in the reference image. However, ground glass opacity (GGO) nodules are very elusive to automatically segment due to their inhomogeneous interior. In other words, it is difficult to automatically define the volume-preserving regions of GGO nodules. In this paper, we propose an accurate and fast nonrigid registration method. It applies the volume-preserving constraint to candidate regions of GGO nodules, which are automatically detected by gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis. Considering that GGO nodules can be characterized by their inner inhomogeneity and high intensity, we identify the candidate regions of GGO nodules based on the homogeneity values calculated by the GLCM and the intensity values. Furthermore, we accelerate our nonrigid registration by using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). In the nonrigid registration process, the computationally expensive procedures of the floating-image transformation and the cost-function calculation are accelerated by using CUDA. The experimental results demonstrated that our method almost perfectly preserves the volume of GGO nodules in the floating image as well as effectively aligns the lung between the reference and floating images. Regarding the computational performance, our CUDA-based method delivers about 20× faster registration than the conventional method. Our method can be successfully applied to a GGO nodule follow-up study and can be extended to the volume-preserving registration and subtraction of specific diseases in other organs (e.g., liver cancer).},

  abstract = {A critical element in determining biologic behavior of pulmonary nodules is volume and temporal volume change. We evaluate variability in nodule volume among readers and measuring methods.
55 small ($<$2 cm) lung nodules were measured in long- and short-axis dimensions independently by 4 radiologists, using 3 methods: 1) hard copy, 2) GE Advantage Windows workstation (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), 3) Siemens IMACS workstation (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselan, NJ). Nodule margin was recorded as smooth, lobulated, or spiculated. Volume was calculated from diameter measurements. Variability in nodule volume was evaluated within each reader, between readers, and across measurement tools.
Mean nodule short-axis diameter was 5.3 mm; mean long-axis diameter 7.2 mm. There was statistically significant variation among readers and measurement method for nodule volume. Volume was significantly larger using hard-copy measurements (51.9\%-54.1\% variation; P $<$ .0001) than either workstation, and not different between workstations. There was greater intraobserver variability in volume using the hard-copy method, and no difference between workstation methods. Volumes based on measurements from one reader were consistently lower than those from other readers (P = $<$ .001, .003, and .02); volume was consistently larger for another reader (P $<$ .0001, .03, and .12). Reader agreement for nodule margin was good to excellent.
Considerable interobserver and intraobserver variability in measuring nodules exists using hard-copy and computer tools. Since a small change in diameter indicates a much larger change in volume, this may be significant when using early repeat CT to follow small pulmonary nodules. Computer-aided diagnostic tools that reproducibly measure nodule volume are strongly needed.},

For juxtapleural nodules, morphological closing, thresholding and labeling are performed to obtain volumetric nodule candidates; gray level and geometric features are extracted and analyzed using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. To locate non-pleural nodules, a discrete-time cellular neural network (DTCNN) uses local shape features which successfully capture the differences between nodules and non-nodules, especially vessels. The DTCNN was trained using genetic algorithm (GA). Testing on 17 cases with 3979 slice images showed the effectiveness of the proposed system, yielding sensitivity of 85.6\% with 9.5 FPs/case (0.04 FPs/image). Moreover, the CAD system detected many nodules missed by human visual reading. This showed that the proposed CAD system acted effectively as an assistant for human experts to detect small nodules and provided a "second opinion" to human observers.},

Volumetric measurements were performed using software. The relative percentage error and the absolute percentage error between the volume measures on computed tomography and the reference-standard volumes were calculated. Correlations between the mean absolute percentage error and the mean attenuation of nodules and between the ratio of solid component and the mean attenuation of nodules were analyzed.
The relative percentage errors showed that there was substantial underestimation of nodule volumes at 30, 60, and 90 mA and substantial overestimation of volumes at 120, 150, 180, and 210 mA, but there was no statistically significant difference in absolute percentage errors (P = .876). Pearson's correlation coefficient of the mean absolute percentage errors of nodules on volumetric measurement versus the mean attenuation value of nodules showed a negative correlation, and the ratio of solid component to whole nodule versus the mean attenuation of nodules showed a positive correlation.},

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of multiple algorithms on a reference data set. The study was organized by the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA).
The study was organized as a public challenge. Computed tomography scans of synthetic lung tumors in an anthropomorphic phantom were acquired by the Food and Drug Administration. Tumors varied in size, shape, and radiodensity. Participants applied their own semi-automated volume estimation algorithms that either did not allow or allowed post-segmentation correction (type 1 or 2, respectively). Statistical analysis of accuracy (percent bias) and precision (repeatability and reproducibility) was conducted across algorithms, as well as across nodule characteristics, slice thickness, and algorithm type.
Eighty-four percent of volume measurements of QIBA-compliant tumors were within 15\% of the true volume, ranging from 66\% to 93\% across algorithms, compared to 61\% of volume measurements for all tumors (ranging from 37\% to 84\%). Algorithm type did not affect bias substantially; however, it was an important factor in measurement precision. Algorithm precision was notably better as tumor size increased, worse for irregularly shaped tumors, and on the average better for type 1 algorithms. Over all nodules meeting the QIBA Profile, precision, as measured by the repeatability coefficient, was 9.0\% compared to 18.4\% overall.
The results achieved in this study, using a heterogeneous set of measurement algorithms, support QIBA quantitative performance claims in terms of volume measurement repeatability for nodules meeting the QIBA Profile criteria.},

CT scans were performed with inspiration suspended at total lung capacity (TLC) and then at residual volume (RV) in 41 subjects, in whom 75 indeterminate lung nodules were detected. A fully automated contouring program was used to segment the lungs; followed by segmentation of all nodules and the corresponding lobe using semiautomated contouring in both TLC and RV scans. The percent changes in lung and lobar volumes between TLC and RV were correlated with percent changes in nodule diameters and volumes.
Both nodule diameter and volume varied nonuniformly from TLC to RV-some nodules decreased in size, while others increased. There was a 16.8\% mean change in absolute volume across all nodules. Stratified by size, the mean value of the absolute percent volume changes for nodules $>$ or =5 mm and $<$5 mm were not significantly different (P = .26). Stratified by maximum attenuation, the mean value of the absolute percent volume changes between the TLC and RV series for noncalcified (17.7\%, SD = 13.1) and completely calcified nodules (8.6\% SD = 5.7) were significantly different (P $<$ .05).
Significant differences in nodule size were measured between TLC and RV scans. This has important implications for standardizing acquisition protocols in any setting where size and, more important, size change are being used for purposes of lung cancer staging, nodule characterization, or treatment response assessment.},

The dataset has about 40 000 volume measurements of 48 nodules (5-20 mm, four shapes, three radiodensities) estimated by a matched-filter estimator from CT images involving 72 imaging protocols. Technical assessment was performed under a framework suggested by QIBA, which aimed to minimize the inconsistency of terminologies and techniques used in the literature. Accuracy and precision of lung nodule volume measurements were examined by analyzing the linearity, bias, variance, root mean square error (RMSE), repeatability, reproducibility, and significant and substantial factors that contribute to the measurement error. Statistical methodologies including linear regression, analysis of variance, and restricted maximum likelihood were applied to estimate the aforementioned metrics. The analysis was performed on both the whole dataset and a subset meeting the criteria proposed in the QIBA Profile document.
Strong linearity was observed for all data. Size, slice thickness × collimation, and randomness in attachment to vessels or chest wall were the main sources of measurement error. Grouping the data by nodule size and slice thickness × collimation, the standard deviation (3.9\%-28\%), and RMSE (4.4\%-68\%) tended to increase with smaller nodule size and larger slice thickness. For 5, 8, 10, and 20 mm nodules with reconstruction slice thickness ≤0.8, 3, 3, and 5 mm, respectively, the measurements were almost unbiased (-3.0\% to 3.0\%). Repeatability coefficients (RCs) were from 6.2\% to 40\%. Pitch of 0.9, detail kernel, and smaller slice thicknesses yielded better (smaller) RCs than those from pitch of 1.2, medium kernel, and larger slice thicknesses. Exposure showed no impact on RC. The overall reproducibility coefficient (RDC) was 45\%, and reduced to about 20\%-30\% when the slice thickness and collimation were fixed. For nodules and CT imaging complying with the QIBA Profile (QIBA Profile subset), the measurements were highly repeatable and reproducible in spite of variations in nodule characteristics and imaging protocols. The overall measurement error was small and mostly due to the randomness in attachment. The bias, standard deviation, and RMSE grouped by nodule size and slice thickness × collimation in the QIBA Profile subset were within ±3\%, 4\%, and 5\%, respectively. RCs are within 11\% and the overall RDC is equal to 11\%.
The authors have performed a comprehensive technical assessment of lung nodule volumetry with a matched-filter estimator from CT scans of synthetic nodules and identified the main sources of measurement error among various nodule characteristics and imaging parameters. The results confirm that the QIBA Profile set is highly repeatable and reproducible. These phantom study results can serve as a bound on the clinical performance achievable with volumetric CT measurements of pulmonary nodules.},

This study suggests that metastatic pulmonary nodules grow or regress at a relatively constant rate that is independent of pretreatment size. Growth and regression rates do not generally fluctuate, although tumor nodules may remain stationary or arrested for variable time periods.

Stimuli were 80 single sections from 13 normal chest CT studies. On half of the images, 3-5-mm-diameter nodules were superimposed electronically at random locations. Four observers viewed images in six formats and sizes that ranged from 6 on 1 (133 x 133 mm) to 80 on 1 (40 x 40 mm). The images were viewed at a fixed distance of 55 cm and at an unrestricted, variable distance.
With the fixed viewing distance, nodule detection decreased with smaller image sizes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) decreased from 0.857 for the 6-on-1 format to 0.671 for the 80-on-1 format (P = .0001). With a variable viewing distance, Az decreased from 0.884 to 0.834 across all formats (difference not statistically significant). However, there was a significant drop in performance with the smallest images (P $<$ .05). Overall, Az for the fixed and variable viewing distances was significantly different (P $<$ .001).
Reducing image size leads to decreased lung nodule detection on CT scans viewed at a fixed distance; however, the observer can compensate for the smaller image by adjusting the viewing distance.},

The volume measurement repeatability was determined by using the approach described by Bland and Altman.
One hundred one subjects (70 men, 31 women; mean age, 58 years) with 233 eligible nodules (mean volume, 98.3 mm(3); range, 5-869 mm(3)) were identified. The 95\% confidence interval for difference in measured volumes was in the range of +/-27\%. About 70\% of measurements had a relative difference in nodule volume of less than 10\%. No malignant lesions were registered during the follow-up of these subjects.
Semiautomatic volumetry is sufficiently accurate and repeatable and may be useful in assisting with lung nodule management in a lung cancer screening program.},

  abstract = {To retrospectively investigate the effect of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system on radiologists' performance for detecting small pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) examinations, with a panel of expert radiologists serving as the reference standard.
Institutional review board approval was obtained. Our dataset contained 52 CT examinations collected by the Lung Image Database Consortium, and 33 from our institution. All CTs were read by multiple expert thoracic radiologists to identify the reference standard for detection. Six other thoracic radiologists read the CT examinations first without and then with CAD. Performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristics (FROC) and the jackknife FROC analysis methods (JAFROC) for nodules above different diameter thresholds.
A total of 241 nodules, ranging in size from 3.0 to 18.6 mm (mean, 5.3 mm) were identified as the reference standard. At diameter thresholds of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm, the CAD system had a sensitivity of 54\%, 64\%, 68\%, and 76\%, respectively, with an average of 5.6 false positives (FPs) per scan. Without CAD, the average figures of merit (FOMs) for the six radiologists, obtained from JAFROC analysis, were 0.661, 0.729, 0.793, and 0.838 for the same nodule diameter thresholds, respectively. With CAD, the corresponding average FOMs improved to 0.705, 0.763, 0.810, and 0.862, respectively. The improvement achieved statistical significance for nodules at the 3 and 4 mm thresholds (P = .002 and .020, respectively), and did not achieve significance at 5 and 6 mm (P = .18 and .13, respectively). At a nodule diameter threshold of 3 mm, the radiologists' average sensitivity and FP rate were 0.56 and 0.67, respectively, without CAD, and 0.67 and 0.78 with CAD.
CAD improves thoracic radiologists' performance for detecting pulmonary nodules smaller than 5 mm on CT examinations, which are often overlooked by visual inspection alone.},

  doi = {10.1378/chest.08-2040},
  abstract = {Detection of small indeterminate pulmonary nodules (4 to 10 mm in diameter) in clinical practice is increasing, largely because of increased utilization and improved imaging technology. Although there currently exists software for CT scan machines that automate nodule volume estimation, the imprecision associated with volume estimates is particularly poor for nodules $<$ or = 6 mm in diameter, with greater imprecision associated with increasing CT scan slice thickness. This study examined the effects of the volume estimation error associated with four CT scan slice thicknesses (0.625, 1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mm) on estimates of volume doubling time (VDT) for solid nodules of various sizes.
Data reflecting the accuracy of 1,624 automated volume estimations were obtained from experiments incorporating volume estimation software, performed on a commercially available lung phantom. These data informed mathematical simulations that were used to estimate imprecision around VDT estimates for hypothetical pairs of volume estimates for a given solid pulmonary nodule observed at different time points.
The confidence intervals around the VDT estimates were extremely wide for 2.50- and 5.00-mm slice thicknesses, often encompassing values traditionally associated with both benignity and malignity for simulated 1- and 2-mm growths in diameter.
Because of the inaccuracy in automated volume estimation, the confidence a clinician should have in estimating VDT should be highly dependent on the degree of observed growth and on the CT scan slice thickness. The performance of CT scanners with slice thicknesses of $>$ or = 2.5 mm for assessing growth in pulmonary nodules is essentially inadequate for 1-mm changes in nodule diameter.},

A computer program utilizing a standard geometric model was used to simulate theoretical slices through a perfectly spherical nodule of known size, position, and density within a background of "lung" of known fixed density. Assuming a threshold density, partial volume effect of a voxel was simulated using published slice and pixel sensitivity profiles. At a given slice thickness and nodule size, 100 scans were simulated differing only in scan start position, then repeated for multiple node sizes at three simulated slice thicknesses. Diameter was measured using a standard, automated algorithm. The frequency of measured diameters was tabulated; average errors and standard deviations (SD) were calculated. For a representative 5-mm nodule, average measurement error ranged from +10 to -23\% and SD ranged from 0.07 to 0.99 mm at slice thicknesses of 0.75 to 5 mm, respectively. At fixed slice thickness, average error and SD decreased from peak values as nodule size increased. At fixed nodule size, SD increased as slice thickness increased. Average error exhibited dependence on both slice thickness and threshold. Variance and error in nodule diameter measurement associated with nodule-slice position exists due to geometrical limitations. This can lead to false interpretations of nodule growth or stability that could affect clinical management. The variance is most pronounced at higher slice thicknesses and for small nodule sizes. Measurement error is slice thickness and threshold dependent.},

  abstract = {Software oriented three-dimensional (3D) volumetric measurement of pulmonary nodules has been feasible in the follow-up of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, however, its value need a further validation. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the chest CT data of patients with pulmonary nodules to compare the intra-observer variability of 3D and two-dimensional (2D) volumetric measurement.
Eighty-six pulmonary nodules in chest CT scans of 79 subjects were retrospectively analyzed. One radiologist measured the nodules twice with a 7 days interval using 2D and 3D methods respectively. The maximal diameter (X), the perpendicular diameter (Y) on maximal cross sectional area of the nodule and the caudo-cranial diameter (Z) were measured and the volume was calculated by two models: spherical and elliptical model. The 3D measurements were acquired with semi-automated software with manual adjustment on unsatisfied nodule segmentation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of nodule location and morphology on 3D nodule segmentation. ANOVA and correlation test were used to evaluate the difference among three methods. Bland-Altman method was applied to quantify the intra-observer variability.
Software achieved satisfied segmentation for 86.4\% nodules. The irregular and juxtavacular nodules have significantly high odds rations (OR) of unsatisfied segmentation as 4.0, 4.5, respectively. The volume measured by three method was significantly different (F=6.5, P=0.012), while the repeated measurements did not led to significant difference (F=1.813, P=0.182). The Spearman correlation efficient between 3D volume and 2D volume with sphere and ellipsoid model was 0.97, 0.88. The 95\% limits of agreement of RD between two repeated measurements were -14\%-11.6\%, -37.7\%-39.9\% and -39.8\%-45.8\% for 3D, 2D with elliptical model and spherical model, respectively.
The 3D volume measurement of pulmonary nodules is more repeatable than 2D volume measurement. Unsatisfied segmentation can occurred on a small number of nodules, especially for irregular and juxtavascular nodules. For these nodules, the measurement of 3D diameters is recommended.},

The volumes of 100 solid intraparenchymal nodules (mean volume 88.10 mm(3); range 7.36-595.25 mm(3)) studied with the same multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) protocol were determined using two different versions of the same volumetric software (LungCARE 2006G and LungCARE 2007S). The 2006G version is based on a single-segmentation algorithm, whereas the newer version features two algorithms: SmallSizeNodule and AllSizeNodule. The results obtained with the 2006G version were compared with those of the 2007S version with the SmallSizeNodule algorithm, as recommended by the user manual. In addition, we compared the volumetric measurements obtained by the two different algorithms of the 2007S version.
The 2006G version and the 2007S version with the SmallSizeNodule algorithm agreed in only two of 100 cases and showed a mean variability of 1.66\% (range 0\%-8.78\%). A more significant volumetric discrepancy was observed between the two different algorithms of the 2007S version, with the AllSizeNodule algorithm providing on average larger volumes (mean variability 71.08\%; range 6.02\%-218.80\%) than SmallSizeNodule. Volume discrepancies were more pronounced in the subgroups of smaller nodules in all comparisons.
There is variability also in the results provided by different versions of the same volumetric software, and this may affect the calculation of the nodule-doubling time. Computer-aided assessment of the growth of lung nodules should always be performed using the same version of volumetric software and the same segmentation algorithm.},

WW 850 HU, WL -750 HU; (c) 'broad lung setting': WW 1350 HU, WL -550 HU. Measurements obtained using either lung setting were highly accurate irrespective of collimation while measurements obtained using soft tissue settings were inaccurate.

Seventy-five individual nodules identified on 29 lowdose, unenhanced, MDCT chest examinations were selected for volumetric analysis. Each image data set was reconstructed in three ways (slice thickness/reconstruction interval): 1.25 mm/0.625 mm, 2.5 mm/2 mm, and 5 mm/2.5 mm. Volumetric measurements were made on all 75 nodules at 1.25- and 2.5-mm slice thicknesses and on 57 of 75 nodules at the 5-mm thickness using Volume Analysis software. For 69 of 75 nodules, measurements were obtained on 1.25- and 2.5-mm-thick sections using a different commercially available software system, LN500 R2 software. Volume variability between different slice thicknesses was correlated with nodule diameter, shape, and margination using multiple linear regression. Percent differences between measurements obtained with the two software systems were calculated. Significance of relative volume differences between slice thicknesses and software packages was assessed using a one-sample Student's t-test.
Although statistically significant differences in volumes between different section thicknesses were seen only for the tiny nodule size group, many individual nodules showed substantial volume variation. Significant differences were seen in nodule volume variability for smaller nodules (3-10 mm) compared with larger nodules ($>$ or = 11 mm) (p $<$ 0.0001), as well as spiculated compared with smooth nodules, within a single size group (p $<$ 0.05). No effect of nodule shape (round vs elongated) was noted. Statistically significant differences in measurements obtained with the two software systems were seen only with 2.5-mm-thick sections (p = 0.001).
CT slice thickness variation resulted in significant differences in volume measurements for tiny nodules. A spiculated margin was shown to have a significant effect on nodule volume variability within a single size group. Use of different software packages resulted in significant volume measurement differences at the 2.5-mm CT slice thickness.},

Thirty pure ground-glass nodules in 25 patients referred for known pure ground-glass nodules were evaluated with two consecutive unenhanced chest CT examinations performed within 10 minutes. For the second limited scan, patients were asked to first get off and then get back on the table to simulate a follow-up examination. CT images were reconstructed using two different algorithms (sharp, B60F; medium sharp, B50F). Two chest radiologists independently measured the volumes and attenuations of pure ground-glass nodules, twice on the first CT scan and once on the second CT scan, using commercial software. Interscan variability was measured using the Bland-Altman method.
Nodule segmentation was successful in 98.3\% (177/180) and 97.8\% (176/180) of measurements with B60F and B50F, respectively. With respect to volume measurements, interscan variability for reviewer 1 was -17.7\% to 18.3\% with B60F and -18.8\% to 15.7\% with B50F; interscan variability for reviewer 2 was -18.6\% to 18.9\% with B60F and -15.6\% to 17.2\% with B50F. With respect to attenuation measurements, interscan variability for reviewer 1 was -7.2\% to 7.9\% with B60F and -7.9\% to 9.4\% with B50F; interscan variability for reviewer 2 was -7.7\% to 8.1\% with B60F and -8.5\% to 9.9\% for B50F.
Variations in volume and attenuation measurements of persistent pure ground-glass nodules using commercial software were reasonably small, allowing the detection of clinically relevant growth.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine interobserver variability in volume measurements of lung tumors (including part-solid and nonsolid types) using novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and a machine learning approach and to determine the potential reasons for variability.
In 60 consecutive patients with peripheral lung cancer, the three-dimensional volumes of nodules were measured using the perimeter method by an experienced chest radiologist. In addition, for the same patients, maximal diameters and three-dimensional volumes were measured with and without a novel CAD tool by six observers. The coefficient of variance (CV) as index of interobserver variability was calculated. For the measurement of volume, the results of the perimeter method were compared to those of the CAD method. Furthermore, the CV was calculated for the following subgroups: nodule diameter, internal opacity, margin, spiculation, and adherence to vessels and the chest wall.
There was significant interobserver variability among the six observers for manual, but not CAD, measurements of maximal diameter (P $<$ .001 and P = .207, respectively). Volume measured with the perimeter method by a chest radiologist was well correlated with volume measured with the aid of the CAD system by six radiologists (r = 0.98-0.99). There was no significant difference in the CV for size, internal opacity, spiculation of nodules, or adherence to pulmonary vessels and the chest wall. The CV was significantly higher for obscure marginal nodules than for clear marginal nodules (P $<$ .01).
The novel CAD tool could be used to measure the volume of not only solid but also part-solid and nonsolid lung tumors.},

  abstract = {The study investigates the effect of a substantial dose reduction on the variability of lung nodule volume measurements by assessing and comparing nodule volumes using a dedicated semiautomated segmentation software on ultralow-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard-dose computed tomography (SD-CT) data. In 20 patients, thin-slice chest CT datasets (1 mm slice thickness; 20\% reconstruction overlap) were acquired at ultralow-dose (120 kV, 5 mAs) and at standard-dose (120 kV, 75 mAs), respectively, and analyzed using the segmentation software OncoTREAT (MeVis, Bremen, Germany; version 1.3). Interobserver variability of volume measurements of 202 solid pulmonary nodules (mean diameter 11 mm, range 3.2-44.5 mm) was calculated for SD-CT and ULD-CT. With respect to interobserver variability, the 95\% confidence interval for the relative differences in nodule volume in the intrascan analysis was measured with -9.7\% to 8.3\% (mean difference -0.7\%) for SD-CT and with -12.6\% to 12.4\% (mean difference -0.2\%) for ULD-CT. In the interscan analysis, the 95\% confidence intervals for the differences in nodule volume ranged with -25.1\% to -23.4\% and 26.2\% to 28.9\% (mean difference 1.4\% to 2.1\%) dependent on the combination of readers and scans. Intrascan interobserver variability of volume measurements was comparable for ULD-CT and SD-CT data. The calculated variability of volume measurements in the interscan analysis was similar to the data reported in the literature for CT data acquired with equal radiation dose. Thus, the evaluated segmentation software provides nodule volumetry that appears to be independent of the dose level with which the CT source dataset is acquired.},

Of the 281 patients, 39.5\% had at least one lung nodule identified. Fifty-two nodules had typical benign calcification patterns. Of the remaining nodules, 78 were resected and 20 were followed up. Seventeen nodules resected were cancerous, of which 13 were primary lung cancers. Of the resected nodules there were 28 nodules not identified by the preoperative radiologic evaluation.
Nodules are frequently seen in patients undergoing lung volume reduction operations. The overall incidence of cancer was 6.4\%, with several only identified in the pathologic examination. Survival at short follow-up has been excellent for those with primary lung cancer. Nodules seen in this group of patients should be aggressively diagnosed and managed.},

54 artificial nodules in a chest phantom were scanned three times with CT. CT values were measured with LC and mROI. The intrascan-r was assessed with three measurements in the first scan, and the interscan-r with measurements in three consecutive scans (one observer). Intrascan-r und interobserver-r (two obs.) were assessed in the first scan and in contrast-enhanced CT of 51 nodules from 15 patients (kernels b50f and b80f). Intrascan-r and interscan-r were described as the mean range and interobserver-r as the mean difference of CT values. The significance of differences was tested using t-test and sign test.
Reproducibility was significantly higher for volumetry-based measurements in both artificial and patient nodules (range 0.11 vs. 6.16 HU for intrascan-r, 2.22 vs. 7.03 HU for interscan-r, difference 0.11 vs. 18.42 HU for interobserver-r; patients: 1.78 vs. 13.19 HU (b50f-Kernel) and 1.88 vs. 27.4 HU (b80f-Kernel) for intrascan-r, 3.71 vs. 22.43 HU for interobserver-r). Absolute CT values differed significantly between convolution kernels (pat./mROI: 29.3 [b50f] and 151.9 HU [b80f] pat./LC: 5 [b50f] and 147 HU [b80f]).
The reproducibility of volumetry-based measurements of CT values in pulmonary nodules is significantly higher and should therefore be recommended, e. g. in dynamic chest CT protocols. Reproducibility does not depend on absolute CT values.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the actual standardized uptake value (SUV) by using the lesion size from computer tomography (CT) scan to correct for resolution and partial volume effects in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This retrospective study included 47 patients with lung lesions seen on CT scan whose diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy or by follow up CT scan when the PET result was considered negative for malignancy. Each lesion's FDG uptake was quantified by the SUV using two methods: by measuring the maximum voxel SUV (maxSUV) and by using the lesion's size on CT to calculate the actual SUV (corSUV). Among small lesions (2.0 cm or smaller on CT scan), ten were benign and 17 were malignant. The average maxSUV was 1.43+/-0.77 and 3.02+/-1.74 for benign and malignant lesions respectively. When using an SUV of 2.0 as the cutoff to differentiate benignity and malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 65\%, 70\%, and 67\% respectively. When an SUV of 2.5 was used for cutoff, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 47\%, 80\%, and 59\% respectively. The average corSUV was 1.65+/-1.09 and 5.28+/-2.71 for benign and malignant lesions respectively. Whether an SUV of either 2.0 or 2.5 was used for cutoff, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy remained 94\%, 70\%, and 85\% respectively. The only malignant lesion that was falsely considered benign with both methods was a bronchioalveolar carcinoma which did not reveal any elevated uptake of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Of the large lesions (more than 2.0 cm and less than 6.0 cm), one was benign and 19 were malignant and the corSUV technique did not significantly change the accuracy. It is concluded that measuring the SUV by using the CT size to correct for resolution and partial volume effects offers potential value in differentiating malignant from benign lesions in this population. This approach appears to improve the accuracy of FDG-PET for optimal characterization of small lung nodules.},

The data presented are a reanalysis of data acquired in other studies, including the public database from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and from a study of liver tumors.
The principal result is that a given RECIST diameter predicts volume to a factor of 16 or 10 for the two data sets, respectively, by examining 95\% prediction bounds and that changes in volume are predicted only little better: to within a factor of 7 for the liver data. The WHO criteria reduce the prediction bounds by a factor of 1.3 in all cases. Also, the RECIST threshold of 10 mm to measure a nodule corresponds to a transition zone width of a factor of more than 2 in volume for the nodules in the LIDC database.
While the RECIST diameter is certainly correlated with the volume, and for changes in these quantities, the use of the diameter introduces additional variation assuming volume is the quantity of interest. Exactly how much this reduces the statistical power of clinical drug trials is a key open question for future research.},

First, the lung area is segmented by active contour modeling followed by some masking techniques to transfer non-isolated nodules into isolated ones. Then, nodules are detected by the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using efficient 2D stochastic and 3D anatomical features. Contours of detected nodules are then extracted by active contour modeling. In this step all solid and cavitary nodules are accurately segmented. Finally, lung tissues are classified into four classes: namely lung wall, parenchyma, bronchioles and nodules. This classification helps us to distinguish a nodule connected to the lung wall and/or bronchioles (attached nodule) from the one covered by parenchyma (solitary nodule). At the end, performance of our proposed method is examined and compared with other efficient methods through experiments using clinical CT images and two groups of public datasets from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and ANODE09. Solid, non-solid and cavitary nodules are detected with an overall detection rate of 89\%; the number of false positive is 7.3/scan and the location of all detected nodules are recognized correctly.},

Its main goal is to process some specific types of nodules connected to the pleura or vessels. It consists of some basic image processing operations as well as dedicated routines for the specific cases of nodules. The evolutionary computation is performed on the image and seed points in order to shorten the FC analysis and improve its accuracy. After the FC application, the remaining vessels are removed during the postprocessing stage.

  abstract = {To retrospectively evaluate the effect of contrast medium on the three-dimensional volumetric measurement of pulmonary nodules.
The study was approved by the local institutional review committee, with waiver of informed consent. Sixty pulmonary nodules in 60 patients (17 women, 43 men; age range, 29-82 years) were imaged before and after administration of contrast medium with a 64-channel multidetector computed tomographic (CT) scanner; reconstructed images with a section thickness of 0.625 mm were obtained by using a bone algorithm and a standard algorithm. Volumetric measurements of pulmonary nodules were performed by using commercially available software, and the postcontrast volume ratio was calculated by dividing the postcontrast volume by the precontrast volume. Precontrast and postcontrast volumes were then analyzed by using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The median measured volumes of pulmonary nodules were 817 mm(3) (precontrast imaging, bone algorithm), 887 mm(3) (postcontrast imaging, bone algorithm), 812 mm(3) (precontrast imaging, standard algorithm), and 855 mm(3) (postcontrast imaging, standard algorithm). The measured volumes obtained with the bone algorithm were significantly larger than those obtained with the standard algorithm, both before and after administration of contrast medium (P $<$ .01); with both the standard algorithm and the bone algorithm, the measured postcontrast volumes were significantly larger than the precontrast volumes (P $<$ .01). The postcontrast volume ratio was more than 1.0 in 45 cases (75\%) when the bone algorithm was used and in 53 cases (88\%) when the standard algorithm was used. The mean postcontrast volume ratio was 1.054 with the bone algorithm and 1.065 with the standard algorithm.
The measured volume of pulmonary nodules obtained by using three-dimensional volumetric software increased after administration of contrast medium. Moreover, the measured volume of pulmonary nodules that was obtained with the bone algorithm was larger than that obtained with the standard algorithm, regardless of whether contrast medium was used.},

Retrospective review of all patients undergoing LVRS at the University of Michigan between January 1995 and June 1996. Those undergoing simultaneous LVRS and resection of a suspected pulmonary malignancy formed the study group and underwent history and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, chest radiography, and high-resolution CT of the chest. If heterogeneous emphysema was found, cardiac imaging and single-photon emission CT perfusion lung scanning were performed. All study patients participated in pulmonary rehabilitation preoperatively. Age- and sex-matched patients who had undergone standard lobectomy for removal of pulmonary malignancy during the same period formed the control group.
Of 75 patients who underwent LVRS, 11 had simultaneous resection of a pulmonary nodule. In 10 patients, the nodules were radiographically apparent with 1 demonstrating central calcification. Histologic evaluation revealed six granulomas, two hamartomas, and three neoplastic lesions (one adenocarcinoma, one squamous cell, and one large cell carcinoma). Preoperative FEV1 was 26.18+/-2.49\% predicted in the LVRS group and 81.36+/-6.07\% predicted (p=0.000001) in the control group, and the FVC was 65.27+/-5.17\% predicted vs 92.18+/-5.53\% predicted (p=0.002). Two LVRS patients had a PaCO2 $>$45 mm Hg while 11 exhibited oxygen desaturation during a 6-min walk test. Postoperative complications occurred in two LVRS patients and three control patients. The mean length of stay in the LVRS group (7.55+/-1.10 days) was not different than in the control group (8.81+/-1.56 days). Three months after LVRS and simultaneous nodule resection, FEV1 rose by 47\%, FVC by 25\%, and all study patients noted less dyspnea as measured by transitional dyspnea index.
Simultaneous LVRS and resection of a suspected bronchogenic carcinoma is feasible and associated with minimal morbidity and significantly improved pulmonary function and dyspnea.},

An automatic three-dimensional segmentation algorithm proposed here efficiently segmented the tissue clusters (nodules) inside the lung. However, an automatic morphological region-grow segmentation algorithm that was implemented to segment the well-circumscribed nodules present inside the lung did not segment the juxta-pleural nodule present on the inner surface of wall of the lung. A novel edge bridge and fill technique is proposed in this article to segment the juxta-pleural and pleural-tail nodules accurately. The centroid shift of each candidate nodule was computed. The nodules with more centroid shift in the consecutive slices were eliminated since malignant nodule's resultant position did not usually deviate. The three-dimensional shape variation and edge sharp analyses were performed to reduce the false positives and to classify the malignant nodules. The change in area and equivalent diameter was more for malignant nodules in the consecutive slices and the malignant nodules showed a sharp edge. Segmentation was followed by three-dimensional centroid, shape and edge analysis which was carried out on a lung computed tomography database of 20 patient with 25 malignant nodules. The algorithms proposed in this article precisely detected 22 malignant nodules and failed to detect 3 with a sensitivity of 88\%. Furthermore, this algorithm correctly eliminated 216 tissue clusters that were initially segmented as nodules; however, 41 non-malignant tissue clusters were detected as malignant nodules. Therefore, the false positive of this algorithm was 2.05 per patient.},

  abstract = {To assess whether measuring the solid portion of adenocarcinomas appearing as part-solid ground-glass nodules (GGNs) can predict a patient's prognosis accurately and how the prognosis corresponds to that of solid nodules.
501 patients (solid nodule group, 304; part-solid GGN group, 197) underwent curative surgery for stage I adenocarcinomas. Maximal diameters of the whole lesion including ground-glass opacities (D whole ) and solid components only (D solid ) were measured on CT. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the date of surgery.
D solid was a significant prognostic factor in the part-solid GGN group, while D whole was not. Part-solid GGNs with D solid ≤2~cm showed significantly better DFS (P = 0.016) and OS (P = 0.004) than solid nodules; however, those with D solid $>$2~cm did not show a significant difference. Hazard ratio (HR) for increase in D solid was significantly greater in part-solid GGNs than in solid nodules (P = 0.009). For OS, HR for increase in D solid was greater in part-solid GGNs than in solid nodule, which was marginally not significant (P = 0.060).
D solid was better than D whole for prognosis prediction of adenocarcinomas appearing as part-solid GGNs. In addition, the influence of D solid on prognosis in the part-solid GGN group was greater than in the solid nodule group.
• Dsolid is a better prognosis indicator than Dsolid in part-solid GGN adenocarcinomas • Part-solid GGN adenocarcinoma show better prognosis than solid adenocarcinomas when Dsolid ≤2~cm • Dsolid has greater prognostic influence in part-solid GGN adenocarcinomas than solid adenocarcinomas.},

  abstract = {The high frequency of non-calcified pulmonary nodules (NCN) $<$10mm incidentally detected on a multi-detector CT (MDCT) of the chest raises the question of how clinicians and radiologists should deal with these nodules. Management algorithms for solitary pulmonary nodules $>$10mm do not carry across to sub-centimeter lesions. Purpose of this review is to provide a 10-step approach for routinely detected sub-centimeter NCN on a MDCT in healthy persons in order to be able to make an optimal discrimination between benign and malignant NCNs. Recommendations are primarily based on individual cancer risk, the presence or absence of calcifications and nodule size. In nodules $>$4-5mm nodule consistency, margin and shape should be taken into account. Next steps in the nodule evaluation are the assessment of localization, nodule number, presence or absence of growth and volume doubling time. Growth is defined as a volume doubling time of 400 days or less, based on volumetry. For nodules $<$4mm, a follow-up CT at 12 months is recommended in high risk persons, whilst for low-risk persons no follow-up is needed. If no growth is observed at 12 months, no further follow-up is required. For solid, smooth or attached indeterminate NCN between 5 and 10mm we recommend an annual repeat scan, whilst for purely intra-parenchymal nodules a 3-month repeat scan should be made to assess growth. Growing lesions with a volume doubling time $<$400 days require further work-up and diagnosis, otherwise an annual repeat scan to assess growth is recommended.},

  abstract = {Early detection of Ground Glass Nodule (GGN) in lung Computed Tomography (CT) images is important for lung cancer prognosis. Due to its indistinct boundaries, manual detection and segmentation of GGN is labor-intensive and problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level learning-based framework for automatic detection and segmentation of GGN in lung CT images. Our main contributions are: firstly, a multi-level statistical learning-based approach that seamlessly integrates segmentation and detection to improve the overall accuracy for GGN detection (in a subvolume). The classification is done at two levels, both voxel-level and object-level. The algorithm starts with a three-phase voxel-level classification step, using volumetric features computed per voxel to generate a GGN class-conditional probability map. GGN candidates are then extracted from this probability map by integrating prior knowledge of shape and location, and the GGN object-level classifier is used to determine the occurrence of the GGN. Secondly, an extensive set of volumetric features are used to capture the GGN appearance. Finally, to our best knowledge, the GGN dataset used for experiments is an order of magnitude larger than previous work. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a dataset of 1100 subvolumes (100 containing GGNs) extracted from about 200 subjects.},

This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and all patients provided written informed consent. Seventy-one patients (mean age 60.8 years ±9.6) with solitary pulmonary nodules were enrolled. Low-dose VPCT was performed for 38.63s covering the involved lung (70kV, 120mAs, 22 consecutive volume measurements, 50mL iodinated contrast, flow rate 4mL/s). Mean blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV) and k-trans were determined both with the maximum slope+Patlak vs. deconvolution method. Additionally, the difference of VPCT parameters between different type lesions and normal tissue was analyzed. Interobserver agreement for all perfusion parameters was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The effective radiation dose of the VPCT and the total CT scan protocol were recorded. All CT findings were histologically confirmed by surgical intervention.
The mean lesion size was 18.6mm. Interobserver agreement measure with ICC shows high agreement between the measurements (κ=0.85). The effective radiation dose of the VPCT was 9.3mSv. The mean perfusion values for BF, BV and k-trans of 120.6mL/100g tissue/', 11.6mL/100g tissue/', and 18.5mL/100g tissue/' for the deconvolution method, and 50.1mL/100g tissue/', 11.6mL/100g tissue/' and 24.3mL/100g tissue/' for the maximum slope+Patlak method, which were significantly higher than those of normal muscle (20.7mL/100g tissue/', 2.6mL/100g tissue/', and 7.6mL/100g tissue/' for the deconvolution method and 10.9mL/100g tissue/', 3.1mL/100g tissue/' and 8.1mL/100g tissue/' for the maximum slope method). The best overall correlation between calculation methods was achieved for measurements of BF.
The low-dose volume perfusion CT of the solitary pulmonary nodules can effectively reduce the radiation dose and non-invasively assess perfusion of SPN within the entire lesion volume.},

While new three-dimensional volume estimation techniques using MDCT have improved size estimation of nodules with irregular shapes, the effect of acquisition and reconstruction parameters on accuracy (bias) and precision (variance) of the new techniques has not been fully investigated. To characterize the volume estimation performance dependence on these parameters, an anthropomorphic chest phantom containing synthetic nodules was scanned and reconstructed with protocols across various acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Nodule volumes were estimated by a clinical lung analysis software package, LungVCAR. Precision and accuracy of the volume assessment were calculated across the nodules and compared between protocols via a generalized estimating equation analysis. Results showed that the precision and accuracy of nodule volume quantifications were dependent on slice thickness, with different dependences for different nodule characteristics. Other parameters including kVp, pitch, and reconstruction kernel had lower impact. Determining these technique dependences enables better volume quantification via protocol optimization and highlights the importance of consistent imaging parameters in sequential examinations.},

Image data were reconstructed every 0.1 s during one respiratory cycle by a 180 degrees reconstruction algorithm for four independent fractions of the respiratory cycle. Pulmonary nodules were measured along their longest and shortest axes using electronic calipers. Automated volumetry was assessed using commercially available software. The diameters of long and short axes in each frame were 9.0-9.6 mm and 7.1-7.5 mm, respectively. There was fluctuation of the long axis diameters in the third fraction. The mean volume in each fraction ranged from 365 to 394 mm(3). Statistically significant fluctuation was also found in the third fraction. 4D-CT under tidal volume ventilation is feasible to determine diameter or volume of the pulmonary nodule.},

SSNs were previously quantified with time-consuming manual measurements. The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility of semi-automatic SSNs measurements and to compare the results to the manual measurements.
In 33 lung cancer screening participants with 33 SSNs, the nodules were previously quantified by two observers manually. In the present study two observers quantified these nodules by using semi-automated nodule volumetry software. Nodules were quantified for effective diameter, volume and mass. The manual and semi-automatic measurements were compared using Bland-Altman plots and paired T tests. Observer agreement was calculated as an intraclass correlation coefficient. Data are presented as mean (SD).
Semi-automated measurements were feasible in all 33 nodules. Nodule diameter, volume and mass were 11.2 (3.3) mm, 935 (691) ml and 379 (311) milligrams for observer 1 and 11.1 (3.7) mm, 986 (797) ml and 399 (344) milligrams for observer 2, respectively. Agreement between observers and within observer 1 for the semi-automatic measurements was good with an intraclass correlation coefficient $>$0.89. For observer 1 and observer 2, measured diameter was 8.8\% and 10.3\% larger (p$<$0.001), measured volume was 24.3\% and 26.5\% larger (p$<$0.001) and measured mass was 10.6\% and 12.0\% larger (p$<$0.001) with the semi-automatic program compared to the manual measurements.
Semi-automated measurement of the diameter, volume and mass of SSNs is feasible with good observer agreement. Semi-automated measurement makes quantification of mass and volume feasible in daily practice.},

Two observer groups of different radiologic experience (0 and more than 5 years of training, 3 observers each) analysed all lesions with digital callipers and 2 volumetry software packages (click-point depending and robust volumetry) in a semi-automatic and manually corrected mode. For data analysis the variation coefficient (VC) was calculated in per cent for each group and a Wilcoxon test was used for analytic statistics.
Click-point robust volumetry showed with a VC of $<$0.01\% in both groups the smallest interobserver variability. Between experienced and un-experienced observers interobserver variability was significantly different for diameter measurements (p=0.023) but not for semi-automatic and manual corrected volumetry. A significant training effect was revealed for diameter measurements (p=0.003) and semi-automatic measurements of click-point depending volumetry (p=0.007) in the un-experienced observer group.
Compared to diameter measurements volumetry achieves a significantly smaller interobserver variance and advanced volumetry algorithms are independent of observer experience.},

  abstract = {To compare the interobserver variability of the unidimensional diameter and volume measurements of pulmonary nodules in an intrascan and interscan analysis using semi-automated segmentation software on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT) data.
In 33 patients with pulmonary nodules, two chest multi-slice CT (MSCT) datasets (1 mm slice thickness; 20 \% reconstruction overlap) had been consecutively acquired with an ultra-low dose (120 kV, 5 mAs) and standard dose technique (120 kV, 75 mAs). MSCT data was retrospectively analyzed using the segmentation software OncoTREAT (MeVis, Bremen, Germany, version 1.3). The volume of 229 solid pulmonary nodules included in the analysis as well as the largest diameter according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors) were measured by two radiologists. Interobserver variability was calculated and SD-CT and ULD-CT data compared in an intrascan and interscan analysis.
The median nodule diameter (n = 229 nodules) was registered with 8.2 mm (range: 2.8 to 43.6 mm, mean: 10.8 mm). The nodule volume ranged between 0.01 and 49.1 ml (median 0.1 ml, mean 1.5 ml). With respect to interobserver variability, the intrascan analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences (p $>$ 0.05) between ULD-CT and SD-CT with broader limits of agreement for relative differences of RECIST measurements (-31.0 \% + 27.0 \% mean -2.0 \% for SD-CT; -27.0 \% + 38.6 \%, mean 5.8 \% for ULD-CT) than for volume measurements (-9.4 \%, 8.0 \%, mean 0.7 \% for SD-CT; -13 \%, 13 \%, mean 0.0 \% for ULD-CT). The interscan analysis showed broadened 95 \% confidence intervals for volume measurements (-26.5 \% 29.1 \% mean 1.3 \%, and -25.2 \%, 29.6 \%, mean 2.2 \%) but yielded comparable limits of agreement for RECIST measurements.
The variability of nodule volumetry assessed by semi-automated segmentation software as well as nodule size determination by RECIST appears to be independent of the acquisition dose in the CT source dataset. This is particularly important regarding size determination of pulmonary nodules in screening trials using low-dose CT data for follow-up imaging.},

  abstract = {To evaluate intra- and interobserver variability, as well as agreement for nodule size measurements on chest tomosynthesis and computed tomographic (CT) images.
The Regional Ethical Review Board approved this study, and all participants gave written informed consent. Thirty-six segmented nodules in 20 patients were included in the study. Eight observers measured the left-to-right, inferior-to-superior, and longest nodule diameters on chest tomosynthesis and CT images. Intra- and interobserver repeatability, as well as agreement between measurements on chest tomosynthesis and CT images, were assessed as recommended by Bland and Altman.
The difference between the mean manual and the segmented diameter was -2.2 and -2.3 mm for left-to-right and -2.6 and -2.2 mm for the inferior-to-superior diameter for measurements on chest tomosynthesis and CT images, respectively. Intraobserver 95\% limits of agreement (LOA) for the longest diameter ranged from a lower limit of -1.1 mm and an upper limit of 1.0 mm to -1.8 and 1.8 mm for chest tomosynthesis and from -0.6 and 0.9 mm to -3.1 and 2.2 mm for axial CT. Interobserver 95\% LOA ranged from -1.3 and 1.5 mm to -2.0 and 2.1 mm for chest tomosynthesis and from -1.8 and 1.1 mm to -2.2 and 3.1 mm for axial CT. The 95\% LOA concerning the mean of the observers' measurements of the longest diameter at chest tomosynthesis and axial CT were ±2.1 mm (mean measurement error, 0 mm). For the different observers, the 95\% LOA between the modalities ranged from -2.2 and 1.6 mm to -3.2 and 2.8 mm.
Measurements on chest tomosynthesis and CT images are comparable, because there is no evident bias between the modalities and the repeatability is similar. The LOA between measurements for the two modalities raise concern if measurements from chest tomosynthesis and CT were to be used interchangeably.},

  abstract = {Peripheral pulmonary tumours are often quite difficult to diagnose and treat. Their detection brings immediately the problem of whether clinicians should just wait and observe or operate the patients. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a direct correlation between tumour size and the risk for malignancy and whether the tumor size should be considered a risk factor for malignancy.
Between 1997 and 2009, 145 patients with peripheral pulmonary tumours of less than 3 cm in diameter underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) resection for the purpose of histologic examination of the tumor.
The mean age of the patients was 62.60 +/- 0.95 years. The youngest patient was 17 years old and the oldest--82. The study sample included 61 women and 84 men; the men were statistically significantly more than the women (57.3\% and 42.07\%, respectively) (t = 2.74, P $<$ 0.01). The total number of patients we operated were 145 with 198 resected tumours. The diameter of the lesions ranged between 0.30 cm and 3 cm (mean 1.41 +/- 0.06 cm). We found that 108 (54.55\%) of the tumours were malignant, and 90 (45.45\%) were benign, the difference between them failing to reach statistical significance (t = 1.82, P $>$ 0.05). The mean size of malignant lesions was statistically significantly greater than that of benign tumours (1.62 +/- 0.08 cm vs 1.15 +/- 0.06 cm).
The results of this study suggest that the bigger the diameter of the nodule, the greater the percentage share of malignant tumours, which means that the size of the tumour is an important risk factor for malignancy.},

As pulmonary nodules are potential manifestation of lung cancer, we propose a fast and self-adaptive pulmonary nodules segmentation method based on a combination of FCM clustering and classification learning. The enhanced spatial function considers contributions to fuzzy membership from both the grayscale similarity between central pixels and single neighboring pixels and the spatial similarity between central pixels and neighborhood and improves effectively the convergence rate and self-adaptivity of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more accurate segmentation of vascular adhesion, pleural adhesion, and ground glass opacity (GGO) pulmonary nodules than other typical algorithms.},

  abstract = {It has been proven that volumetric measurements could detect subtle changes in small pulmonary nodules in serial CT scans, and thus may play an important role in the follow-up of indeterminate pulmonary nodules and in differentiating malignant nodules from benign nodules. The current study aims to evaluate the effects of different reconstruction parameters on the volumetric measurements of pulmonary nodules in chest CT scans.
Thirty subjects who underwent chest CT scan because of indeterminate pulmonary nodules in General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from December 2009 to August 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 52 pulmonary nodules were included, and all CT data were reconstructed using three reconstruction algorithms and three slice thicknesses. The volumetric measurements of the nodules were performed using the advanced lung analysis (ALA) software. The effects of the reconstruction algorithms, slice thicknesses, and nodule diameters on the volumetric measurements were assessed using the multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures, the correlation analysis, and the Bland-Altman method.
The reconstruction algorithms (F=13.6, P$<$0.001) and slice thicknesses (F=4.4, P=0.02) had significant effects on the measured volume of pulmonary nodules. In addition, the coefficients of variation of nine measurements were inversely related with nodule diameter (r=-0.814, P$<$0.001). The volume measured at the 2.5 mm slice thickness had poor agreement with the volumes measured at 1.25 mm and 0.625 mm, respectively. Moreover, the best agreement was achieved between the slice thicknesses of 1.25 mm and 0.625 mm using the bone algorithm.
Reconstruction algorithms and slice thicknesses have significant impacts on the volumetric measurements of lung nodules, especially for the small nodules. Therefore, the reconstruction setting in serial CT scans should be consistent in the follow-up of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, more importantly for the small nodules.},

  abstract = {Subsolid pulmonary nodules tend to exhibit considerably slower growth rates than solid lesions, nevertheless, higher malignancy probability. The diagnosis of indeterminate nodules largely depends on the growth evaluation during follow-up. The growth can manifested as an increase in size or the appearance and/or subsequent increase of solid components. The mass reflect the product of volume and density and can be more sensitive in growth evaluation. However, the repeatability needs a further validation. The purpose of this study is to assess the intra and inter-observer variability of mass measurement for subsolid nodules.
80 subsolid nodules in 44 patients were retrospectively enrolled. Both the volume and mass were measured by two radiologists using blind method independently. Intra-observer and inter-observer variability were analyzed and compared by Bland-Altman method intra-class correlation test and Wilcoxon test.
Software achieved satisfied segmentation for 92.5\% nodules. Of them, 35\% underwent manual modification. The 95\% limits of agreement for intra-observer variability were -11.5\%-10.4\% for mass and -8.4\%-8.8\% for volume. The 95\% limits of agreement for inter-observer variability were -17.4\%-19.3\% for mass and -17.9\%-19.4\% for volume.The intra-class correlation foefficients between volume and mass measument was 0.95 and 0.93 (both P$<$0.001) and no significant differences (P=0.78, 0.09) was found for intra- and inter-observer variability. Manual modification of the segmentation caused the worse mass measurement repeatability in spite of the reader satisfaction.
The repeatability of mass measurement has no significant difference with that of volume measurement and may act as a reliable method in the follow-up of subsolid nodules.},

Major and minor complications were documented.
Overall diagnostic accuracy, pneumothorax rate, and thoracostomy tube insertion rates were 67.6\%, 34.5\%, and 5\%, respectively. Of the 98 patients with malignancy, 77 patients (78.6\%) had a definite diagnostic biopsy. Overall, nodules$>$1.5 cm were statistically more likely to result in a diagnostic specimen (73.5\%) than nodules$<$or=1.5 cm (51.4\%; P=.012). Similarly, diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was higher in nodules$>$1.5 cm than in those$<$or=1.5 cm (81.3\% vs. 69.6\%); however, this was not statistically significant. There was no correlation between nodule size and the incidence of complications.
Overall, diagnostic accuracy of CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy of lung nodules$<$or=1.5 cm is slightly lower than that of nodules$>$1.5 cm. However, the diagnostic accuracy for malignancy is high in both groups, with a low risk of complications.},

  abstract = {The most common semiquantitative method of evaluation of pulmonary lesions using 18F-FDG PET is FDG standardized uptake value (SUV). An SUV cutoff of 2.5 or greater has been used to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. The goal of our study was to investigate the correlation between the size of pulmonary nodules and the SUV for benign as well as for malignant nodules.
Retrospectively, 173 patients were selected from 420 referrals for evaluation of pulmonary lesions. All patients selected had a positive CT and PET scans and histopathology biopsy. A linear regression equation was fitted to a scatter plot of size and SUVmax for malignant and benign nodules together. A dot diagram was created to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using an SUVmax cutoff of 2.5.
The linear regression equations and (R2)s as well as the trendlines for malignant and benign nodules demonstrated that the slope of the regression line is greater for malignant than for benign nodules. Twenty-eight nodules of group one ($<$or= 1.0 cm) are plotted in a dot diagram using an SUVmax cutoff of 2.5. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated to be 85\%, 36\% and 54\% respectively. Similarly, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for an SUVmax cutoff of 2.5 and found to be 91\%, 47\%, and 79\% respectively for group 2 (1.1-2.0 cm); 94\%, 23\%, and 76\%, respectively for group 3 (2.1-3.0 cm); and 100\%, 17\%, and 82\%,, respectively for group 4 ($>$ 3.0 cm). The previous results of the dot diagram indicating that the sensitivity and the accuracy of the test using an SUVmax cutoff of 2.5 are increased with an increase in the diameter of pulmonary nodules.
The slope of the regression line is greater for malignant than for benign nodules. Although, the SUVmax cutoff of 2.5 is a useful tool in the evaluation of large pulmonary nodules ($>$ 1.0 cm), it has no or minimal value in the evaluation of small pulmonary nodules ($<$or= 1.0 cm).},

This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the research board at the authors' institution; patients' informed consent was not required. Fifty-one nodules in 23 patients (seven men, 16 women; mean age, 59 years; age range, 39-75 years) were selected on low-dose CT scans that were compressed to levels of 10:1, 20:1, 30:1, and 40:1 by using a two-dimensional JPEG 2000 wavelet-based image compression method. Nodules were classified according to size ($<$ or = 5 mm or $>$ 5 mm in diameter), location (central, peripheral, or abutting pleura or fissures), and attenuation (solid, calcified, or subsolid). Regions of interest were placed on the original images and transposed onto compressed images. Nodule volumes on original (noncompressed) and compressed images were measured by using a computer-assisted method. A mixed-model analysis of variance was conducted for statistical evaluation.
Nodule volumes averaged 388.1 mm3 (range, 34-3474 mm3). There were three calcified, 33 solid noncalcified, and 15 subsolid nodules (13 with ground-glass attenuation). Average volume decreased with increasing compression level, to 383 mm3 (10:1), 370 mm3 (20:1), 360 mm3 (30:1), and 354 mm3 (40:1). No significant difference was identified between measurements obtained on original images and those compressed to a level of 10:1. Significant differences were noted, however, between original images and those compressed to a level of 20:1 or greater (P $<$ .05). Compression level significantly interacted with nodule size, location, and attenuation (P $<$ .001). The effect of compression was greater for nodules with ground-glass attenuation than for those with higher attenuation values. The difference in mean volumes between original images and those compressed to a level of 20:1 was 34.9 mm3 for nodules with ground-glass attenuation, compared with 8.3 mm3 for higher-attenuation nodules, a 4.2-fold difference.
Nodule volumes measured on images compressed to a level of 20:1 differed significantly from those measured on noncompressed images, especially for nodules with ground-glass attenuation. This difference could affect the assessment of nodule change in size as measured with computer-assisted methods.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the influence of radiation dose settings and reconstruction algorithms on the measurement accuracy and reproducibility of semi-automated pulmonary nodule volumetry.
CT scans were performed on a chest phantom containing various nodules (10 and 12mm; +100, -630 and -800HU) at 120kVp with tube current-time settings of 10, 20, 50, and 100mAs. Each CT was reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). Semi-automated volumetry was performed by two radiologists using commercial volumetry software for nodules at each CT dataset. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of CT images were also obtained. The absolute percentage measurement errors and differences were then calculated for volume and mass. The influence of radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm on measurement accuracy, reproducibility and objective image quality metrics was analyzed using generalized estimating equations.
Measurement accuracy and reproducibility of nodule volume and mass were not significantly associated with CT radiation dose settings or reconstruction algorithms (p$>$0.05). Objective image quality metrics of CT images were superior in IMR than in FBP or iDose(4) at all radiation dose settings (p$<$0.05).
Semi-automated nodule volumetry can be applied to low- or ultralow-dose chest CT with usage of a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm without losing measurement accuracy and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {To prospectively evaluate in a phantom the effects of reconstruction kernel, field of view (FOV), and section thickness on automated measurements of pulmonary nodule volume.
Spherical and lobulated pulmonary nodules 3-15 mm in diameter were placed in a commercially available lung phantom and scanned by using a 16-section computed tomographic (CT) scanner. Nodule volume (V) was determined by using the diameters of 27 spherical nodules and the mass and density values of 29 lobulated nodules measured by using the formulas V = (4/3)pi r(3) (spherical nodules) and V = 1000 x (M/D) (lobulated nodules) as reference standards, where r is nodule radius; M, nodule mass; and D, wax density. Experiments were performed to evaluate seven reconstruction kernels and the independent effects of FOV and section thickness. Automated nodule volume measurements were performed by using computer-assisted volume measurement software. General linear regression models were used to examine the independent effects of each parameter, with percentage overestimation of volume as the dependent variable of interest.
There was no substantial difference in the accuracy of volume estimations across the seven reconstruction kernels. The bone reconstruction kernel was deemed optimal on the basis of the results of a series of statistical analyses and other qualitative findings. Overall, volume accuracy was significantly associated (P $<$ .0001) with larger reference standard-measured nodule diameter. There was substantial overestimation of the volumes of the 3-5-mm nodules measured by using the volume measurement software. Decreasing the FOV facilitated no significant improvement in the precision of lobulated nodule volume measurements. The accuracy of volume estimations--particularly those for small nodules--was significantly (P $<$ .0001) affected by section thickness.
Substantial, highly variable overestimation of volume occurs with decreasing nodule diameter. A section thickness that enables the acquisition of at least three measurements along the z-axis should be used to measure the volumes of larger pulmonary nodules.},

To better assess the safety, accuracy, and risk factors for complications of CTTCB of pulmonary nodules, we conducted a retrospective study at a high-volume academic center in an endemic coccidioidomycosis area.
We conducted a retrospective study of 203 patients who underwent CTTCB of pulmonary nodules between December 2010 and May 2013. We collected demographics, clinical, and radiographic data. Each case was reviewed for complications. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by comparing CTTCB with final diagnoses.
The overall complication rate was 25~\%. Pneumothorax accounted for 24~\% of complications with 7~\% of pneumothoraces requiring chest tube. 1.5~\% were complicated by hemoptysis but none required blood transfusions. There was an association between complications and age, presence of emphysema on CT, traversed lung length, and lesion depth. The overall sensitivity of the CTTCB for all types of lung cancer was 93~\%, and specificity of 100~\%. The positive predictive value of CTTCB for lung cancer was 100~\%. The sensitivity and specificity of CTTCB for a coccidiomycosis lung nodule was 83~\% with a specificity of 100~\% with a PPV of 100~\%.
Our study demonstrates that CTTCB is a relatively safe method for evaluating lung nodules and highly accurate in evaluating lung nodules due to coccidioidomycosis in an endemic area. The primary risk factors for complications from CTTCB are the presence of emphysema on CT scan, lesion depth, and traversed lung length.},

Twenty-three patients with known pulmonary nodules (diameter 2-40 mm, mean diameter 7 mm) underwent spiral chest CT (collimation 5 mm, pitch 1). Images were reconstructed at 3- and 5-mm intervals (RI). Hard copies were analyzed by two radiologists who recorded every nodule with regard to location, diagnostic confidence ("definite," "probable") and nodule size in increments of 1 mm with specific attention to correct classification into one of three size classes ($<$ or = 5 mm, 6-10 mm, $>$ 10 mm). Interobserver variability was determined with Pearson's correlation coefficient and kappa measure. Of a total of 286 nodules, 103 nodules were found accordingly by both readers at 3 mm RI, and 96 at 5 mm RI. There was a good correlation of measurements (in millimeters) between both readers (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.89-0.95). Interobserver variability in categories was good at both reconstruction intervals (kappa: 0.61 at 3 mm, 0.74 at 5 mm RI) and very good (0.81) at 5 mm RI when uncertain nodules were excluded. Spiral CT allows reproducible size determination of pulmonary nodules as shown by good interobserver agreement in exact size measurement and categorization into three size classes.},

From 50 patients a total of 125 cuboidal regions of interest (3 × 3 × 1.5 cm volumes) showing a single nodule (≤ 8 mm) and 27 normal cuboids were selected. Image sets were reconstructed with the software from raw data simulating different dose levels: 300 (original dose), 220, 180, 140, 100, 80, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, and 5 reference mAs. A logistic regression model was used to analyze detectability for three blinded readers. Odds ratios were calculated for nodule size smaller than 3 mm versus 3 mm and larger and for nodule attenuation of -300 HU and greater versus less than -300 HU.
Tube current-time settings of 10 mAs and greater were not associated with a significant difference in individual reader sensitivity compared with the standard setting of 300 mAs. At 5 mAs only one reader had a significant decrease in sensitivity, from 82\% to 77\% (p = 0.0035). According to the odds ratios and logistic regression results, the strongest negative effect on sensitivity can be assumed for low nodule density followed by small nodule size and dose level. The mean nodule volume measurement error between 5 and 300 mAs was 2.2\% ± 18\% (SD) and much lower than the interobserver volume measurement error rate of 38\% ± 45\%.
The results show the feasibility of a low-dose CT protocol at 10 mAs for follow-up of lung nodules. Computer-aided volume measurement in follow-up of lung nodules decreases interobserver variability.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) are occasionally diagnosed as invasive adenocarcinomas. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological features of patients with pulmonary GGNs to identify factors predictive of pathological invasion.
We retrospectively evaluated 101 pulmonary GGNs resected between July 2006 and November 2013 and pathologically classified them as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; n = 47), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA; n = 30), or invasive adenocarcinoma (I-ADC; n = 24). The age, sex, smoking history, tumor size, and computed tomography (CT) attenuation of the 3 groups were compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to identify factors that could predict the presence of pathologically invasive adenocarcinomas.
Tumor size was significantly larger in the MIA and I-ADC groups than in the AIS group. CT attenuation was significantly greater in the I-ADC group than in the AIS and MIA groups. In ROC curve analyses, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor size (cutoff, 11 mm) were 95.8\% and 46.8\%, respectively, and those for CT attenuation (cutoff, -680 HU) were 95.8\% and 35.1\%, respectively; the areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. A combination of tumor size and CT attenuation (cutoffs of 11 mm and -680 HU for tumor size and CT attenuation, respectively) yielded in a sensitivity and specificity of 91.7\% and 71.4\%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.82.
Tumor size and CT attenuation were predictive factors of pathological invasiveness for pulmonary GGNs. Use of a combination of tumor size and CT attenuation facilitated more accurate prediction of invasive adenocarcinoma than the use of these factors independently.},

For such a task a low-bias size estimator is needed so that the true effect of factors such as acquisition and reconstruction parameters, nodule characteristics and others can be assessed. Towards this goal, we have developed a matched filter based on an adaptive model of the object acquisition and reconstruction process. Our model derives simulated reconstructed data of nodule objects (templates) which are then matched to computed tomography data produced from imaging the actual nodule in a phantom study using corresponding imaging parameters. This approach incorporates the properties of the imaging system and their effect on the discrete 3-D representation of the object of interest. Using a sum of absolute differences cost function, the derived matched filter demonstrated low bias and variance in the volume estimation of spherical synthetic nodules ranging in density from -630 to +100 HU and in size from 5 to 10 mm. This work could potentially lead to better understanding of sources of error in the task of lung nodule size measurements and may lead to new techniques to account for those errors.},

With nine excluded, 65 consecutive patients having a SPN with histopathologic proof or follow-up underwent a 30s PCT using the deconvolution model were evaluated. Kruskal-Wallis tests and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were underwent. Four radiologists assessed nodules independently and retrospectively. Diagnostic capability was compared for CT alone and PCT plus CT. ROC analysis, McNemar test, and weighted kappa statistics were performed.
Significant differences were found in parameters between malignant and benign nodules (p$<$0.0001 for blood flow, blood volume, and permeability surface area product), SPNs were more likely to be malignant by using threshold values of more than 55 ml/100 g/min, 2.5 ml/100 g, and 10 ml/100 g/min, respectively. PCT plus CT was significantly better in overall sensitivity (93\%, p=0.004) and accuracy (94\%, p=0.003) compared to CT alone, not specificity (96\%). Area under the curve for ROC analyses of PCT plus CT was significantly larger than that of CT alone (p=0.018). Mean weighted kappa for PCT plus CT was 0.715, that for CT alone was 0.447.
Volume first-pass PCT can distinguish SPNs. Using PCT plus routine CT may be more sensitive and accurate for differentiating malignant from benign nodules than CT alone and allows more confidence and constancy.},

Eighty-four individuals referred for lung cancer screening (mean age: 54.5±10.8 years) underwent low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and ultra-low-dose CT. CT examinations were performed with attenuation-based tube current modulation. Reference tube voltage and current were set to 120kV/25mÅs for LDCT and 80kV/4mÅs for ultra-low-dose CT. CT images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) for LDCT, and with FBP and IR for ultra-low-dose CT datasets. A reference standard was established by a consensus panel of 2 different radiologists on LDCT. Volume and diameter of the solid nodules were measured on LDCT with FBP and ultra-low dose CT with FBP and IR. Interobserver and interscan variability were analyzed and compared by the Bland-Altman method.
A total of 127 nodules were identified, including 105 solid nodules, 15 part solid nodules, 7 ground glass nodules. On ultra-low-dose CT scans, the effective radiation dose was 0.13±0.11mSv. A total of 113 (88.9\%) and 110 (86.6\%) true-positive nodules with FBP versus 117 (92.1\%) and 118(92.9\%) with IR were detected by two observers, respectively. The volume and size of the 105 solid nodules were measured, with mean volume/diameter of 46.5±46.6 mm(3)/5.1±1.6mm. There was no significant difference in nodule volume or diameter measurements between ultra-low-dose CT and LDCT protocols for solid nodules.
Ultra-low-dose CT with iterative reconstruction has high sensitivity for lung nodule detection without significant difference in nodule size and volume measurement compared to LDCT.},

  abstract = {The solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs ) is one of the most common findings on chest radiographs. It becomes possible to provide more accurately quantitative information about blood flow patterns of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs ) with multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the quantifiable parameters of blood flow pattern derived with dynamic CT in maliagnant solitary pulmonary nodules and tumor size.
68 patients with maliagnant solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs ) (diameter $<$=4 cm)underwent multi-location dynamic contrast material-enhanced (nonionic contrast material was administrated via the antecubital vein at a rate of 4mL/s by an autoinjector, 4*5mm or 4*2.5mm scanning mode with stable table were performed.) serial CT. Precontrast and postcontrast attenuation on every scan was recorded. Perfusion (PSPN), peak height (PHSPN), ratio of peak height of the SPN to that of the aorta (SPN-to-A ratio)and mean transit time(MTT) were calculated. The correlation between the quantifiable parameters of blood flow pattern derived with dynamic CT in maliagnant solitary pulmonary nodules and tumor size were assessed by means of linear regression analysis.
No significant correlations were found between the tumor size and each of the peak height (PHSPN), ratio of peak height of the SPN to that of the aorta (SPN-to-A ratio), perfusion (PSPN)and mean transit time(r=0.18,P=0.14; r=0.20,P=0.09; r=0.01, P=0.95; r=0.01, P=0.93).
No significant correlation is found between the tumor size and each of the quantifiable parameters of blood flow pattern derived with dynamic CT in maliagnant solitary pulmonary nodules.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of the sizes of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in predicting their potential malignancies.
A total of 379 patients with pathologically confirmed SPNs were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three groups based on the SPN sizes: ≤10, 11-20, and $>$20 mm. The computed tomography (CT) findings of these SPNs were analyzed in these three groups to identify the malignant and benign SPNs. The risk factors were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis.
Of these 379 patients, 120 had benign SPNs and 259 had malignant SPNs. In the ≤10 mm SPN group, air cavity density was the risk factor for malignancy, with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy being 77.8\%, 75.0\%, and 76.3\%. In the 11-20 mm SPN group, age, glitches and vascular aggregation were the risk factors for malignancy, with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy being 91.3\%, 56.9\%, and 81.5\%. In the $>$20 mm SPN group, age, lobulation, and vascular aggregation were the risk factors for malignancy, with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy being 88.6\%, 57.1\%, and 79.1\%.
According to CT findings of SPNs, age, glitches, lobulation, vascular aggregation, and air cavity density are the risk factors of malignancy, whereas calcification and satellite lesions are the protective factors. During the course of development from small to large nodules, air cavity density could be firstly detected in early stages, followed by glitches and vascular aggregation. Lobulation is associated with relatively large lesions.},

In this study, 55 patients with 66 GGNs underwent unenhanced low-dose CT. GGN segmentation was performed by using 2 volumetry software programs (LungCARE, Siemens Healthcare; LungVCAR, GE Healthcare). Successful nodule segmentation was assessed visually and morphologic features of GGNs were evaluated to determine factors affecting segmentation by both types of software. In addition, the measurement accuracy of the software programs was investigated by using an anthropomorphic chest phantom containing simulated GGNs.
The successful nodule segmentation rate was significantly higher in LungCARE (90.9\%) than in LungVCAR (72.7\%) (p = 0.012). Vascular attachment was a negatively influencing morphologic feature of nodule segmentation for both software programs. As for measurement accuracy, mean relative volume measurement errors in nodules ≥ 10 mm were 14.89\% with LungCARE and 19.96\% with LungVCAR. The mean relative attenuation measurement errors in nodules ≥ 10 mm were 3.03\% with LungCARE and 5.12\% with LungVCAR.
LungCARE shows significantly higher segmentation success rates than LungVCAR. Measurement accuracy of volume and attenuation of GGNs is acceptable in GGNs ≥ 10 mm by both software programs.},

Lung segmentation is one of the mandatory steps for initial detection of lung cancer in Posterior-Anterior chest radiographs. On the other hand, many CAD schemes in projection chest radiography may benefit from the suppression of the bony structures that overlay the lung fields, e.g. ribs. The original images are enhanced by an adaptive contrast equalization and non-linear filtering. Then an initial estimation of lung area is obtained based on morphological operations and then it is improved by growing this region to find the accurate final contour, then for rib suppression, we use oriented spatial Gabor filter. The proposed method was tested on a publicly available database of 247 chest radiographs. Results show that this method outperformed greatly with accuracy of 96.25\% for lung segmentation, also we will show improving the conspicuity of lung nodules by rib suppression with local nodule contrast measures. Because there is no additional radiation exposure or specialized equipment required, it could also be applied to bedside portable chest x-rays. In addition to simplicity of these fully automatic methods, lung segmentation and rib suppression algorithms are performed accurately with low computation time and robustness to noise because of the suitable enhancement procedure.},

The volume of 200 solid pulmonary nodules was measured three times using commercially available semi-automated software of low-dose chest CT data-sets reconstructed with 1 mm section thickness and a soft kernel (A), 2 mm and a soft kernel (B), and 2 mm and a sharp kernel (C), respectively. Repeatability coefficients of the three measurements within each setting were calculated by the Bland and Altman method. A three-level model was applied to test the impact of reconstruction setting on the measured volume.
The repeatability coefficients were 8.9, 22.5 and 37.5\% for settings A, B and C. Three-level analysis showed that settings A and C yielded a 1.29 times higher estimate of nodule volume compared with setting B (P = 0.03). The significant interaction among setting, nodule location and morphology demonstrated that the effect of the reconstruction setting was different for different types of nodules. Low-dose CT reconstructed with 1 mm section thickness and a soft kernel provided the most repeatable volume measurement.
A wide, nodule-type-dependent range of agreement between volume measurements with different reconstruction settings suggests strict consistency is required for serial CT studies.},

A total of 7557 participants underwent CT screening in years 1, 2, and 4 of a randomized trial of lung-cancer screening. We used software to evaluate a noncalcified nodule according to its volume or volume-doubling time. Growth was defined as an increase in volume of at least 25\% between two scans. The first-round screening test was considered to be negative if the volume of a nodule was less than 50 mm(3), if it was 50 to 500 mm(3) but had not grown by the time of the 3-month follow-up CT, or if, in the case of those that had grown, the volume-doubling time was 400 days or more.
In the first and second rounds of screening, 2.6\% and 1.8\% of the participants, respectively, had a positive test result. In round one, the sensitivity of the screen was 94.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 86.5 to 98.0) and the negative predictive value 99.9\% (95\% CI, 99.9 to 100.0). In the 7361 subjects with a negative screening result in round one, 20 lung cancers were detected after 2 years of follow-up.
Among subjects at high risk for lung cancer who were screened in three rounds of CT scanning and in whom noncalcified pulmonary nodules were evaluated according to volume and volume-doubling time, the chances of finding lung cancer 1 and 2 years after a negative first-round test were 1 in 1000 and 3 in 1000, respectively.

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the dependency of the accuracy and precision of nodule diameter measurements on the radiation dose level in chest tomosynthesis. Artificial ellipsoid-shaped nodules with known dimensions were inserted in clinical chest tomosynthesis images. Noise was added to the images in order to simulate radiation dose levels corresponding to effective doses for a standard-sized patient of 0.06 and 0.04 mSv. These levels were compared with the original dose level, corresponding to an effective dose of 0.12 mSv for a standard-sized patient. Four thoracic radiologists measured the longest diameter of the nodules. The study was restricted to nodules located in high-dose areas of the tomosynthesis projection radiographs. A significant decrease of the measurement accuracy and intraobserver variability was seen for the lowest dose level for a subset of the observers. No significant effect of dose level on the interobserver variability was found. The number of non-measurable small nodules (≤5 mm) was higher for the two lowest dose levels compared with the original dose level. In conclusion, for pulmonary nodules at positions in the lung corresponding to locations in high-dose areas of the projection radiographs, using a radiation dose level resulting in an effective dose of 0.06 mSv to a standard-sized patient may be possible in chest tomosynthesis without affecting the accuracy and precision of nodule diameter measurements to any large extent. However, an increasing number of non-measurable small nodules (≤5 mm) with decreasing radiation dose may raise some concerns regarding an applied general dose reduction for chest tomosynthesis examinations in the clinical praxis.},

Low-dose CTs were reconstructed using FBP and MBIR for 47 patients with 47 SSNs. Two readers independently classified SSNs into pure or part-solid ground-glass nodules, and measured the size of the whole nodule and solid portion twice on both reconstruction algorithms. Nodule classification agreement was analyzed using Cohen's kappa and compared between reconstruction algorithms using McNemar's test. Measurement variability was investigated using Bland-Altman analysis and compared with the paired t-test.
Cohen's kappa for inter-reader SSN classification agreement was 0.541-0.662 on FBP and 0.778-0.866 on MBIR. Between the two readers, nodule classification was consistent in 79.8 \% (75/94) with FBP and 91.5 \% (86/94) with MBIR (p = 0.027). Inter-reader measurement variability range was -5.0-2.1 mm on FBP and -3.3-1.8 mm on MBIR for whole nodule size, and was -6.5-0.9 mm on FBP and -5.5-1.5 mm on MBIR for solid portion size. Inter-reader measurement differences were significantly smaller on MBIR (p = 0.027, whole nodule; p = 0.011, solid portion).
MBIR significantly improved SSN classification agreement and reduced measurement variability of both whole nodules and solid portions between readers.
• Low-dose CT using MBIR algorithm improves reproducibility in the classification of SSNs. • MBIR would enable more confident clinical planning according to the SSN type. • Reduced measurement variability on MBIR allows earlier detection of potentially malignant nodules.},

While all lung cancers and the intra-pulmonary lymph node were located by ultrasonography, only two of six inflammatory lesions were found. In examining mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, all lymph nodes larger than 10 mm could be seen by ultrasonography. However, the ultrasonography could not distinguish between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes.

28 patients underwent contrast enhanced 64-row CT scans of the chest and abdomen obtained in the clinical routine. All scans were reconstructed with 1, 3, and 5 mm ST. Volume, maximum axial diameter, and areas following the guidelines of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and the World Health Organization (WHO) were measured in all 101 lesions located in the overlap region of both scans using the new software tool OncoTreat (MeVis, Deutschland). The accuracy of quantifications in both scans was evaluated using the Bland and Altmann method. The reproducibility of measurements in dependence on the ST was compared using the likelihood ratio Chi-squared test.
A total of 101 nodules were identified in all patients. Segmentation was considered successful in 88.1\% of the cases without local manual correction which was deliberately not employed in this study. For 80 nodules all 6 measurements were successful. These were statistically evaluated. The volumes were in the range 0.1 to 15.6 ml. Of all 80 lesions, 34 (42\%) had direct contact to the pleura parietalis oder diaphragmalis and were termed parapleural, 32 (40\%) were paravascular, 7 (9\%) both parapleural and paravascular, the remaining 21 (27\%) were free standing in the lung. The trueness differed significantly (Chi-square 7.22, p value 0.027) and was best with an ST of 3 mm and worst at 5 mm. Differences in precision were not significant (Chi-square 5.20, p value 0.074). The limits of agreement for an ST of 3 mm were +/- 17.5 \% of the mean volume for volumetry, for maximum diameters +/- 1.3 mm, and +/- 31.8 \% for the calculated areas.
Automated volumetry of pulmonary nodules using OncoTREAT has a conformable accuracy for an ST of 3 mm and 1 mm and is even more accurate for an ST of 5 mm than unidimensional or bidimensional measurements. A difference of more than +/- 17.5\% occurs with a probability of less than 5\% at an ST of 3 mm.},

This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 20 oncology patients (eight women and 12 men; mean age, 56 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]) who underwent clinically indicated standard-dose thoracic multidetector CT and provided informed consent. Transverse thin slabs of the chest (thickness, 7 mm; reconstruction increment, 3.5 mm) were created by using MIP and VR techniques to reconstruct CT data (collimation, 16 x 0.75 mm) and were reviewed in interactive cine mode. Mean, minimum, and maximum reading time per examination and per radiologist was documented. Three radiologists digitally annotated all nodules seen in a way that clearly determined their locations. The maximum number of nodules detected by the three observers and confirmed by consensus served as the reference standard. Descriptive statistics were calculated, with P $<$ .05 indicating a significant difference. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and confidence intervals for differences between methods were used to compare the sensitivities of the two methods.
VR performed significantly better than MIP with regard to both detection rate (P $<$ .001) and reporting time (P $<$ .001). The superiority of VR was significant for all three observers and for nodules smaller than 11 mm in diameter and was pronounced for perihilar nodules (P = .023). Sensitivities achieved with VR ranged from 76.5\% to 97.3\%, depending on nodule size.
VR is the superior reading method compared with MIP for the detection of small solid intrapulmonary nodules.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on validating our approach for monitoring the development of lung nodules detected in successive chest low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans of a patient. Our methodology for monitoring detected lung nodules includes 3D LDCT data registration, which is a non-rigid technique and involves two steps: (i) global target-to-prototype alignment of one scan to another using the experience gained from a prior appearance model, followed by (ii) local alignment to correct for intricate relative deformations. We propose a new approach for validating the accuracy of our algorithm for elastic lung phantoms constructed with state-of-the-art microfluidics technology and in vivo data. Fabricated from a flexible transparent polymer, i.e. polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the phantoms mimic the contractions and expansions of the lung and nodules as seen during normal breathing. The in vivo data in our study had been collected from a small control group of four subjects and a larger test group of 27 subjects with known ground truth (biopsy diagnosis. The growth rate and diagnostic results for both phantoms and in vivo data confirm the high accuracy of our algorithm.},

In particular, CT perfusion could reduce the number of SPNs, diagnosed as undetermined at morphologic CT, avoiding long term follow-up CT, FDG-PET studies, biopsy or unnecessary surgery with a significant reduction in healthcare costs. In order to reduce the radiation dose, an optimization of the CT perfusion protocol could be obtained using axial mode acquisition, using shorter acquisition time and adaptative statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm.},

  abstract = {The change in volume of lung nodules is being examined as a measure of response to treatment. The aim of~this study was to determine the minimum detectable change in nodule volume with the use of computed tomography.
Four different layouts of synthetic nodules with different shapes but with the same size (5, 8, 9, or 10~mm) for each layout were placed within an anthropomorphic phantom and scanned with a 16-detector-row computed tomography scanner using multiple imaging parameters. Nodule volume estimates were determined using a previously developed matched-filter estimator. Analysis of volume change was then conducted as a detection problem. For each nodule size, the pooled distribution of volume estimates was shifted by a percentage c to simulate a changing nodule, while accounting for standard deviation. The value of c resulting in a prespecified area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was deemed the minimum detectable change for that AUC value.
Both nodule size at baseline and choice of slice collimation protocol had an effect on the value of minimum detectable growth. For AUC~=~0.95, the minimum detectable nodule growth in volume when using the thin-slice collimation protocol (16~×~0.75~mm) was 17\%, 19\%, and 15\% for nodule sizes of 5, 8, and 9~mm, respectively.
Our results indicate that an approximate bound for detectable nodule growth in subcentimeter nodules may be relatively small, on the order of 20\% or less in volume for a thin-slice CT acquisition protocol.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of CT scanning and reconstruction parameters on automated segmentation and volumetric measurements of nodules in CT images. Phantom nodules of known sizes were used so that segmentation accuracy could be quantified in comparison to ground-truth volumes. Spherical nodules having 4.8, 9.5 and 16 mm diameters and 50 and 100 mg cc(-1) calcium contents were embedded in lung-tissue-simulating foam which was inserted in the thoracic cavity of a chest section phantom. CT scans of the phantom were acquired with a 16-slice scanner at various tube currents, pitches, fields-of-view and slice thicknesses. Scans were also taken using identical techniques either within the same day or five months apart for study of reproducibility. The phantom nodules were segmented with a three-dimensional active contour (3DAC) model that we previously developed for use on patient nodules. The percentage volume errors relative to the ground-truth volumes were estimated under the various imaging conditions. There was no statistically significant difference in volume error for repeated CT scans or scans taken with techniques where only pitch, field of view, or tube current (mA) were changed. However, the slice thickness significantly (p $<$ 0.05) affected the volume error. Therefore, to evaluate nodule growth, consistent imaging conditions and high resolution should be used for acquisition of the serial CT scans, especially for smaller nodules. Understanding the effects of scanning and reconstruction parameters on volume measurements by 3DAC allows better interpretation of data and assessment of growth. Tracking nodule growth with computerized segmentation methods would reduce inter- and intraobserver variabilities.},

A total of 48 images comprising phantom nodules of four sizes in six different locations were used. Nodule size measurement errors for measurements using TOMO and CT images compared with the actual size from each observer were calculated. The inter- and intraobserver repeatability of the measured values and the agreement between the two techniques were assessed using the method described by Bland and Altman.
The mean measurement errors for all of the nodules and four observers were -0.84 mm [standard deviation (SD), 0.60 mm] on TOMO and -0.18 mm (SD, 0.71 mm) on CT images. The mean measurement errors for the different observers ranged from -1.11 to -0.55 mm for TOMO and from -0.39 to 0.08 mm for CT. Assessing the agreement between nodule size measurements using TOMO and CT resulted in mean measurement errors of -0.65 mm, with a 95\% limit of agreement of -2.53 to 1.22 mm for comparison of TOMO with CT.
Our results suggest that nodule sizes obtained using TOMO and chest CT are comparable, even for nodules located in areas where the size measurement is limited on simple radiography.
TOMO and CT can be used interchangeably, even for nodules located in a blind area on simple radiography.},

Synthetic lung nodules of four different diameters (3.2, 4.8, 6.4, and 12.7 mm) were scanned with multi-detector row CT. Images were reconstructed at various section thicknesses (0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mm), fields of view (30, 20, and 10 cm), and reconstruction intervals (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm). The nodules were segmented from the simulated background lung region by using four segmentation thresholds (-300, -400, -500, and -600 HU), and their volumes were estimated and compared with a reference standard (measurements according to fluid displacement) by computing the absolute percentage error (APE). APE was regressed against nodule size, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed with APE as the dependent variable and with four within-subject factors (field of view, reconstruction interval, threshold, and section thickness).
The MANOVA demonstrated statistically significant effects for threshold (P = .02), section thickness (P $<$ .01), and interaction of threshold and section thickness (P = .04). The regression of mean APE values on nodule size indicates that APE progressively increases with decreasing synthetic nodule size (R2 = 0.99, P $<$ .01).
For accurate measurement of lung nodule volume, it is critical to select a section thickness and/or segmentation threshold appropriate for the size of a nodule.},

Thirty-nine pulmonary nodules less than 2 cm in diameter were examined by multi-slice CT. All nodules were solid, and located in the peripheral part of the lungs. The resultant 48 parameters images were reconstructed by changing slice thickness (1.25, 2.5, 3.75, or 5 mm), field of view (FOV: 10, 20, or 30 cm), algorithm (high-spatial frequency algorithm or low-spatial frequency algorithm) and reconstruction interval (reconstruction with 50\% overlapping of the reconstructed slices or non-overlapping reconstruction). Volumetric measurements were calculated using commercially available software. The differences between nodule volumes were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test.
The diameter of the nodules was 8.7+/-2.7 mm on average, ranging from 4.3 to 16.4mm. Pulmonary nodule volume did not change significantly with changes in slice thickness or FOV (p$>$0.05), but was significantly larger with the high-spatial frequency algorithm than the low-spatial frequency algorithm (p$<$0.05), except for one reconstruction parameter. The volumes determined by non-overlapping reconstruction were significantly larger than those of overlapping reconstruction (p$<$0.05), except for a 1.25 mm thickness with 10 cm FOV with the high-spatial frequency algorithm, and 5mm thickness. The maximum difference in measured volume was 16\% on average between the 1.25 mm slice thickness/10 cm FOV/high-spatial frequency algorithm parameters and overlapping reconstruction.
Volumetric measurements of pulmonary nodules differ with changes in the reconstruction parameters, with a tendency toward larger volumes in high-spatial frequency algorithm and non-overlapping reconstruction compared to the low-spatial frequency algorithm and overlapping reconstruction.},

Algorithms based on i) 3D morphological opening with anisotropic structuring element and ii) extended mean shift with a Gaussian repelling prior are presented.

This study had institutional review board approval; written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Between June 2004 and March 2005, 20 patients (15 men, five women; age range, 40-84 years; mean age, 57 years) referred for chest CT for known lung metastases underwent two additional low-dose chest CT examinations without contrast material (collimation, 16 x 0.75 mm). Between these examinations, patients got off and on the table to simulate the conditions for a follow-up examination. Noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules between 15 and 500 mm(3) that did not abut vessel or pleura were measured in both studies by using widely applied commercial semiautomated software. Interscan variability was established with the Bland and Altman approach. The impact of nodule shape (spherical or nonspherical) on measurement variability was assessed by using one-way analysis of variance, while the contributions of mean nodule volume and change in lung volume were investigated with univariate linear regression for completely (group A) and incompletely (group B) segmented nodules.
Two hundred eighteen eligible nodules (volume range, 16.4-472.7 mm(3); 106 spherical, 112 nonspherical) were evaluated. The 95\% confidence interval for difference in measured volumes was -21.2\%, 23.8\% (mean difference, 1.3\%). The precision of nodule segmentation was highly dependent on nodule shape (P $<$ .001) and was weakly related to inspiration level for completely segmented nodules (r = -0.20; P $<$ .047), while mean nodule volume did not show any effect (P = .15 and P = .81 for group A and B nodules, respectively).
Variation of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules can be substantial. Segmentation represents the most important factor contributing to measurement variability, while change in inspiration level has only a weak effect for completely segmented nodules.},

We retrospectively evaluated 47 GGO nodules (mixed n = 28, pure n = 19) that had been examined by thin-section helical CT more than once. They were histologically confirmed as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH, n = 13), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC, n = 22), and adenocarcinoma (AC, n = 12). Using computer-aided three-dimensional volumetry software, two radiologists independently performed volumetry of GGO nodules and calculated the VDT using data acquired from the initial and final CT study. We compared VDT among the three pathologies and also compared the VDT of mixed and pure GGO nodules.
The mean VDT of all GGO nodules was 486.4 ± 368.6 days (range 89.0-1583.0 days). The mean VDT for AAH, BAC, and AC was 859.2 ± 428.9, 421.2 ± 228.4, and 202.1 ± 84.3 days, respectively; there were statistically significant differences for all comparative combinations of AAH, BAC, and AC (Steel-Dwass test, P $<$ .01). The mean VDT for pure and mixed GGO nodules was 628.5 ± 404.2 and 276.9 ± 155.9 days, respectively; it was significantly shorter for mixed than pure GGO nodules (Mann-Whitney U-test, P $<$ .01).
The evaluation of VDT using computer-aided volumetry may be helpful in assessing the histological entities of GGO nodules.},

  abstract = {The objectives of our study were to evaluate the in vivo reproducibility of automated volume calculations of small lung nodules with both low-dose and standard-dose CT and to assess whether repeatability within each technique varies according to the diameter, site, or morphology of the nodule or to percentage of emphysema.
Sixty-six subjects with 83 solid pulmonary nodules between 5 and 10 mm in diameter were enrolled in this prospective study. Four consecutive MDCT data sets, two low dose and two standard dose, were obtained for each nodule on separate breath-holds during the same session. The volume of each nodule was calculated by automated software. Repeatability was evaluated by Bland-Altman's approach and the coefficient of repeatability. Associations of the percentage of volume variation between two measurements with nodule diameter, emphysema percentage, nodule site, and nodule morphology were assessed by Spearman's correlation coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis test. A p value of $<$ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The range of variation of the volumes of pulmonary nodules between two subsequent measurements was -38\% +/- 60\% for low-dose CT and -27\% +/- 40\% for standard-dose CT. No significant statistical association was found between variation in volume measurements and nodule site, nodule diameter, nodule morphology, or emphysema percentage by semiautomated calculation of lung density.
Automated volume calculations of small pulmonary nodules can significantly differ between two subsequent breath-holds with both low-dose and standard-dose CT techniques; in clinical practice we recommend that a volume variation of greater than 30\% for nodules between 5 and 10 mm should be confirmed by follow-up CT to be sure that a nodule is actually growing.},

  abstract = {Iterative reconstruction potentially can reduce radiation dose compared with filtered back projection (FBP) for chest CT. This is especially important for repeated CT scanning, as is the case in patients with indeterminate lung nodules. It is currently unknown whether absolute nodule volumes measured with iterative reconstruction are comparable to those measured with FBP. We compared nodule volumes measured with iterative reconstruction and FBP at different CT parameters.
An anthropomorphic chest phantom was scanned using a 256-MDCT scanner at various tube voltages and tube current-time products. Raw data were reconstructed using FBP or a commercially available iterative reconstruction algorithm. Five inserted nodules with 100 HU radiodensity and different sizes (3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 mm) were measured by two observers using semiautomatic software. Volumetric nodule measurements were performed using thin-slice reconstructions.
For very small nodules (volume, 14.1 mm(3); diameter, 3 mm), FBP and iterative reconstruction measurements exhibited large errors and overestimated the nodule size by up to 160\%. For larger nodules (volume, ≥ 65.4 mm(3); diameter, ≥ 5 mm), CT underestimated the actual size, but errors were small (within 25\%) and remained small when the tube voltage and tube current-time product were reduced, even without iterative reconstruction.
In a phantom model, no clinically relevant differences beyond reported interscan variation levels between lung nodule volumes were measured in nodules 5 mm or larger at reduced tube voltage and tube current-time product, with radiation dose reductions up to 90.6\% for both FBP and iterative reconstruction, suggesting that it is safe to convert FBP protocols to iterative reconstruction and reduce tube voltage and tube current-time product for lung nodule follow-up. CT appears to slightly underestimate actual nodule volume.},

A total of 400 low-dose chest CT examinations were randomly selected from the NELSON lung cancer screening trial. CTs were evaluated by two independent readers and processed by CAD. A total of 1,667 findings marked by readers and/or CAD were evaluated by a consensus panel of expert chest radiologists. Performance was evaluated by calculating sensitivity of pulmonary nodule detection and number of false positives, by nodule characteristics and volume.
According to the screening protocol, 90.9~\% of the findings could be excluded from further evaluation, 49.2~\% being small nodules (less than 50~mm(3)). Excluding small nodules reduced false-positive detections by CAD from 3.7 to 1.9 per examination. Of 151 findings that needed further evaluation, 33 (21.9~\%) were detected by CAD only, one of them being diagnosed as lung cancer the following year. The sensitivity of nodule detection was 78.1~\% for double reading and 96.7~\% for CAD. A total of 69.7~\% of nodules undetected by readers were attached nodules of which 78.3~\% were vessel-attached.
CAD is valuable in lung cancer screening to improve sensitivity of pulmonary nodule detection beyond double reading, at a low false-positive rate when excluding small nodules.
• Computer-aided detection (CAD) has known advantages for computed tomography (CT). • Combined CAD/nodule size cut-off parameters assist CT lung cancer screening. • This combination improves the sensitivity of pulmonary nodule detection by CT. • It increases the positive predictive value for cancer detection.},

  abstract = {To determine reproducibility of volume measurements of small pulmonary nodules on computed tomographic (CT) scans and to estimate critical time to follow-up CT.
One hundred fifteen pulmonary nodules for which two thin-section small-field-of-view CT scans were obtained and which were stable during 2-year observation were evaluated. A standard group of 94 nodules (with no or minimal artifact) and an expanded group of 105 nodules (including those with moderate artifacts) were examined. Percentage volume change (PVC) and monthly volumetric growth index (MVGI) were computed for each nodule pair. By using estimates of the variation in PVC in stable nodules as a function of initial diameter, critical time to follow-up CT was estimated; this time is the earliest point at which growth in a nodule of a given size can be reliably identified with repeat CT.
The SD of PVC decreased with increasing nodule size from 18.5\% in 2-5-mm nodules to 10.6\% in 5-8-mm nodules and to 7.47\% in 8-10-mm nodules. Inclusion of cases with moderate motion artifacts increased the SD of PVC to 27.4\% in 2-5-mm nodules, to 17.1\% in 5-8-mm nodules, and to 19.3\% in 8-10-mm nodules. Critical time to follow-up CT for nodules detected at baseline screening was 12, 5, and 3 months and 1 month for those with initial sizes of 2, 5, 8, and 10 mm, respectively. For nodules detected at annual repeat screening, it was 4 and 3 months and 1 month for nodules that were 3, 4, and 5 mm or larger in size, respectively. Mean MVGI in 94 standard cases was 0.06\%, and standard error was 0.21\%.
Factors that affect reproducibility of nodule volume measurements and critical time to follow-up CT include nodule size at detection, type of scan (baseline or annual repeat) on which the nodule is detected, and presence of patient-induced artifacts.},

Forty consecutive patients (25 men and 15 women; mean [SD] age 64 [12] years) referred for staging of malignancy were prospectively included in this single-center, Institutional Review Board-approved study. Imaging using trimodality PET/CT-MR setup (full ring, time-of-flight PET/CT and 3-T whole-body MR imager) comprised PET, low-dose CT for anatomic referencing/attenuation correction of PET, and MR imaging with 3D dual-echo GRE pulse sequence, allowing the reconstruction of water-only (WO) and in-phase (IP) images. Two blinded and independent readers assessed all images randomly for the presence, the location, and the size of pulmonary nodules. Detection rates, defined as the proportion of screened participants with at least 1 pulmonary nodule, were compared between low-dose CT and MR imaging including both WO and IP images.
Inter-reader agreements were high regarding the location (k = 0.93-0.98) and the size of pulmonary nodules (intraclass correlation analysis = 0.94-0.98) in CT and in MR imaging. Computed tomographic scans revealed 66 pulmonary nodules in 34 of the 40 patients (85\%), whereas WO and IP images showed 56 and 58 pulmonary nodules in 33 of the 40 patients (83\%), respectively. The detection rates of CT and MR imaging were similar (P's $>$; 0.05) regarding all nodules, 18F-Fluordesoxyglucose-positive pulmonary nodules, and 18F-Fluordesoxyglucose-negative pulmonary nodules. The size of pulmonary nodules was significantly smaller on WO (P $<$; 0.05; mean difference, 3 mm; 95\% confidence interval, - 13 to 18 mm) and IP images (P $<$; 0.001; mean difference, 4 mm; 95\% confidence interval, -5 to 12 mm) compared with in CT.
Our study indicates that a 3D Dixon-based, dual-echo GRE pulse sequence might be suitable for lung imaging in clinical whole-body PET/MR examinations. Although the detection rates were lower, there was no statistically significant difference on a patient-based evaluation concerning detection rates of pulmonary nodules compared with low-dose CT. Assessment of nodule location can be performed equally well with MR imaging.},

To assess accuracy, 3 polyurethane (PU) spheres (35 HU; diameters: 4, 6 and 10 mm) were examined with a recommended SVP using a multislice CT (collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, pitch 1.25, 20 mAs, slice thickness 1 mm, increment 0.7 mm, medium kernel) and an optimized RTP (collimation 16 x 1.5 mm, pitch 1.25, 100 mAs, reconstructed slice thickness 2 mm, increment 0.4 mm, sharp kernel). For the assessment of intrascan and interscan reproducibility and interobserver variability, 20 artificial small pulmonary nodules were placed in a dedicated ex vivo chest phantom and examined with identical scan protocols. The artificial lesions consisted of a fat-wax-Lipiodol mixture. Phantoms and ex vivo lesions were examined afterwards using commercial volumetry software. To describe accuracy the relative deviations from the true volumes of the PU phantoms were calculated. For intrascan and interscan reproducibility and interobserver variability, the 95 \% normal range (95 \% NR) of relative deviations between two measurements was calculated.
For the SVP the achieved relative deviations for the 4, 6 and 10 mm PU phantoms were - 14.3 \%, - 12.7 \% and - 6.8 \% and were 4.5 \%, - 0.6 \% and - 2.6 \%, respectively, for the optimized RTP. SVP showed a 95 \% NR of 0 - 1.5 \% for intrascan and a 95 \% NR of - 10.8 - 2.9 \% for interscan reproducibility. The 95 \% NR for interobserver variability was - 4.3 - 3.3 \%. The optimized RTP achieved a 95 \% NR of - 3.1 - 4.3 \% for intrascan reproducibility and a 95 \% NR of - 7.0 - 3.5 \% for interscan reproducibility. The 95 \% NR for interobserver variability was - 0.4 - 6.8 \%.

  abstract = {Measuring the size of nodules on chest CT is important for lung cancer staging and measuring therapy response. 3D volumetry has been proposed as a more robust alternative to 1D and 2D sizing methods. There have also been substantial advances in methods to reduce radiation dose in CT. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of dose reduction and reconstruction methods on variability in 3D lung-nodule volumetry.
Reduced-dose CT scans were simulated by applying a noise-addition tool to the raw (sinogram) data from clinically indicated patient scans acquired on a multidetector-row CT scanner (Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare). Scans were simulated at 25\%, 10\%, and 3\% of the dose of their clinical protocol (CTDIvol of 20.9 mGy), corresponding to CTDIvol values of 5.2, 2.1, and 0.6 mGy. Simulated reduced-dose data were reconstructed with both conventional filtered backprojection (B45 kernel) and iterative reconstruction methods (SAFIRE: I44 strength 3 and I50 strength 3). Three lab technologist readers contoured "measurable" nodules in 33 patients under each of the different acquisition/reconstruction conditions in a blinded study design. Of the 33 measurable nodules, 17 were used to estimate repeatability with their clinical reference protocol, as well as interdose and inter-reconstruction-method reproducibilities. The authors compared the resulting distributions of proportional differences across dose and reconstruction methods by analyzing their means, standard deviations (SDs), and t-test and F-test results.
The clinical-dose repeatability experiment yielded a mean proportional difference of 1.1\% and SD of 5.5\%. The interdose reproducibility experiments gave mean differences ranging from -5.6\% to -1.7\% and SDs ranging from 6.3\% to 9.9\%. The inter-reconstruction-method reproducibility experiments gave mean differences of 2.0\% (I44 strength 3) and -0.3\% (I50 strength 3), and SDs were identical at 7.3\%. For the subset of repeatability cases, inter-reconstruction-method mean/SD pairs were (1.4\%, 6.3\%) and (-0.7\%, 7.2\%) for I44 strength 3 and I50 strength 3, respectively. Analysis of representative nodules confirmed that reader variability appeared unaffected by dose or reconstruction method.
Lung-nodule volumetry was extremely robust to the radiation-dose level, down to the minimum scanner-supported dose settings. In addition, volumetry was robust to the reconstruction methods used in this study, which included both conventional filtered backprojection and iterative methods.},

  abstract = {Calcium concentration may be a useful feature for distinguishing benign from malignant lung nodules in computer-aided diagnosis. The calcium concentration can be estimated from the measured CT number of the nodule and a CT number vs calcium concentration calibration line that is derived from CT scans of two or more calcium reference standards. To account for CT number nonuniformity in the reconstruction field, such calibration lines may be obtained at multiple locations within lung regions in an anthropomorphic phantom. The authors performed a study to investigate the effects of patient body size, anatomic region, and calibration nodule size on the derived calibration lines at ten lung region positions using both single energy (SE) and dual energy (DE) CT techniques. Simulated spherical lung nodules of two concentrations (50 and 100 mg/cc CaCO3) were employed. Nodules of three different diameters (4.8, 9.5, and 16 mm) were scanned in a simulated thorax section representing the middle of the chest with large lung regions. The 4.8 and 9.5 mm nodules were also scanned in a section representing the upper chest with smaller lung regions. Fat rings were added to the peripheries of the phantoms to simulate larger patients. Scans were acquired on a GE-VCT scanner at 80, 120, and 140 kVp and were repeated three times for each condition. The average absolute CT number separations between the calibration lines were computed. In addition, under- or overestimates were determined when the calibration lines for one condition (e.g., small patient) were used to estimate the CaCO3 concentrations of nodules for a different condition (e.g., large patient). The authors demonstrated that, in general, DE is a more accurate method for estimating the calcium contents of lung nodules. The DE calibration lines within the lung field were less affected by patient body size, calibration nodule size, and nodule position than the SE calibration lines. Under- or overestimates in CaCO3 concentrations of nodules were also in general smaller in quantity with DE than with SE. However, because the slopes of the calibration lines for DE were about one-half the slopes for SE, the relative improvement in the concentration estimates for DE as compared to SE was about one-half the relative improvement in the separation between the calibration lines. Results in the middle of the chest thorax section with large lungs were nearly completely consistent with the above generalization. On the other hand, results in the upper-chest thorax section with smaller lungs and greater amounts of muscle and bone were mixed. A repeat of the entire study in the upper thorax section yielded similar mixed results. Most of the inconsistencies occurred for the 4.8 mm nodules and may be attributed to errors caused by beam hardening, volume averaging, and insufficient sampling. Targeted, higher resolution reconstructions of the smaller nodules, application of high atomic number filters to the high energy x-ray beam for improved spectral separation, and other future developments in DECT may alleviate these problems and further substantiate the superior accuracy of DECT in quantifying the calcium concentrations of lung nodules.},

  issn = {1076-6332},
  abstract = {We quantified differences in the detection of simulated lung nodules on computed radiographs on the basis of variations in nodule size, local contrast, body habitus (global contrast), and exposure.
A step-wedge phantom was developed to simulate the attenuation ranges of the lung, retrocardiac, and subdiaphragmatic regions of the adult human chest. Additional Lucite wedges were used to simulate two different body thicknesses and to provide variable structural noise. Soft-tissue-equivalent nodules of 3-mm and 5-mm diameter that resulted in 10\% differences in attenuation from lung equivalence were embedded in lung-equivalent material. By superimposing the sheets in various positions, 84 unique nodule configurations containing eight nodules per image were exposed on a computed radiography system. Computed radiographs were acquired at two different exposures approximating standard exposure and underexposure. For each resulting phantom image, seven observers scored the presence or absence of a nodule within individual cells of a 5 x 5 grid matrix.
True-positive fractions for 3-mm-diameter nodules were very low across all conditions. True-positive fractions for 5-mm-diameter nodules varied from 0.23 to 0.98. Significant differences in the conspicuity of 5-mm nodules depended on differences in phantom thickness and differences in the locations of nodules within lung-, retrocardiac-, or subdiaphragmatic-equivalent regions. Accuracy in detecting nodules was significantly lower at lower exposures when nodules were located in the subdiaphragmatic-equivalent region.
On computed radiographs, small nodules (5-mm diameter) can be reliably detected when they are located in areas of high or moderate surrounding local contrast, such as the lung or mediastinal regions. Detection of nodules decreases in regions of lower optical density corresponding to the subdiaphragmatic regions of the chest. The decrease in nodule detectability is greatest under conditions that simulate large body thickness and underexposure.},

Between examinations, patients got off and on the table. Volumes of all pulmonary nodules were determined on both examinations using six nodule evaluation software packages. Variability (upper limit of the 95\% confidence interval of the Bland-Altman plot) was calculated for nodules for which segmentation was visually rated as adequate. We evaluated 214 nodules (mean diameter 10.9 mm, range 3.3 mm-30.0 mm). Software packages provided adequate segmentation in 71\% to 86\% of nodules (p $<$ 0.001). In case of adequate segmentation, variability in volumetry between scans ranged from 16.4\% to 22.3\% for the various software packages. Variability with five to six software packages was significantly less for nodules $>$or=8 mm in diameter (range 12.9\%-17.1\%) than for nodules $<$8 mm (range 18.5\%-25.6\%). Segmented volumes of each package were compared to each of the other packages. Systematic volume differences were detected in 11/15 comparisons. This hampers comparison of nodule volumes between software packages.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of iterative reconstruction (IR) on pulmonary nodule volumetry with chest computed tomography (CT).
Twenty patients (12 women and 8 men, mean age 61.9, range 32-87) underwent evaluation of pulmonary nodules with a 64-slice CT-scanner. Data were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and IR (Philips Healthcare, iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6) at similar radiation dose. Volumetric nodule measurements were performed with semi-automatic software on thin slice reconstructions. Only solid pulmonary nodules were measured, no additional selection criteria were used for the nature of nodules. For intra-observer and inter-observer variability, measurements were performed once by one observer and twice by another observer. Algorithms were compared using the concordance correlation-coefficient (pc) and Friedman-test, and post-hoc analysis with the Wilcoxon-signed ranks-test with Bonferroni-correction (significance-level p$<$0.017).
Seventy-eight nodules were present including 56 small nodules (volume$<$200 mm(3), diameter$<$8 mm) and 22 large nodules (volume≥200 mm(3), diameter≥8 mm). No significant differences in measured pulmonary nodule volumes between FBP, iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6 were found in both small nodules and large nodules. FBP and iDose(4)-levels 2, 4 and 6 were correlated with pc-values of 0.98 or higher for both small and large nodules. Pc-values of intra-observer and inter-observer variability were 0.98 or higher.
Measurements of solid pulmonary nodule volume measured with standard-FBP were comparable with IR, regardless of the IR-level and no significant differences between measured volumes of both small and large solid nodules were found.},

  abstract = {The goal was to investigate the effects of choosing between different metrics in estimating the size of pulmonary nodules as a factor both of nodule characterization and of performance of computer aided detection systems, because the latter are always qualified with respect to a given size range of nodules.
This study used 265 whole-lung CT scans documented by the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) using their protocol for nodule evaluation. Each inspected lesion was reviewed independently by four experienced radiologists who provided boundary markings for nodules larger than 3 mm. Four size metrics, based on the boundary markings, were considered: a unidimensional and two bidimensional measures on a single image slice and a volumetric measurement based on all the image slices. The radiologist boundaries were processed and those with four markings were analyzed to characterize the interradiologist variation, while those with at least one marking were used to examine the difference between the metrics.
The processing of the annotations found 127 nodules marked by all of the four radiologists and an extended set of 518 nodules each having at least one observation with three-dimensional sizes ranging from 2.03 to 29.4 mm (average 7.05 mm, median 5.71 mm). A very high interobserver variation was observed for all these metrics: 95\% of estimated standard deviations were in the following ranges for the three-dimensional, unidimensional, and two bidimensional size metrics, respectively (in mm): 0.49-1.25, 0.67-2.55, 0.78-2.11, and 0.96-2.69. Also, a very large difference among the metrics was observed: 0.95 probability-coverage region widths for the volume estimation conditional on unidimensional, and the two bidimensional size measurements of 10 mm were 7.32, 7.72, and 6.29 mm, respectively.
The selection of data subsets for performance evaluation is highly impacted by the size metric choice. The LIDC plans to include a single size measure for each nodule in its database. This metric is not intended as a gold standard for nodule size; rather, it is intended to facilitate the selection of unique repeatable size limited nodule subsets.},

To perform these measurements, they used both a loop planimeter and a caliper. Forty-two and 40 participants repeated measurements 3 days later on pulmonary and surface nodules. Accuracy, reproducibility, and time efficiency were evaluated.
The linear caliper measurements overestimated pulmonary nodule and surface nodule size by a median of 37\% and 23\%, respectively. Circumferential loop planimeter measurements overestimated pulmonary nodule size and surface nodule size by a median of 8\% and 17\%, respectively. Interobserver reproducibility for the planimeter was greater than that for the caliper, as evidenced by thinner measurement interquartile ranges. Furthermore, intraobserver reproducibility was higher for the planimeter, with its variability being only 31.4\% and 25.5\% as large as that of the caliper when measuring the pulmonary and surface nodules, respectively.
Circumferential measurements provide better accuracy, reproducibility, and speed in measuring both pulmonary and surface nodules than do perpendicular diameters.},

Baseline low-dose screening CT examinations from 134 participants enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial were reviewed by 7 chest radiologists. All participants consented to the use of their deidentified images for research purposes. Screening results were classified as positive when noncalcified nodules larger than 4 mm in diameter were present. Follow-up evaluation was recommended according to the nodule diameter: 4 mm or smaller, more than 4 to 8 mm, and larger than 8 mm. When multiple nodules were present, recommendations were based on the largest nodule. Readers initially assessed the nodule presence visually and measured the average nodule diameter manually. Revision of their decisions after reviewing the CAD marks and size measurement was allowed. Interobserver agreement evaluated using multirater κ statistics was compared between initial assessment and that with CAD.
Multirater κ values for the positivity of the screening results and follow-up recommendations were improved from moderate (κ = 0.53-0.54) at initial assessment to good (κ = 0.66-0.67) after reviewing CAD results. The average percentage of agreement between reader pairs on the positivity of screening results and follow-up recommendations per case was also increased from 77\% and 72\% at initial assessment to 84\% and 80\% with CAD, respectively.
Computer-aided diagnosis may improve the reader agreement on the positivity of screening results and follow-up recommendations in the assessment of low-dose screening CT.},

  abstract = {An estimated 150,000 pulmonary nodules are identified each year, and the number is likely to increase given the results of the National Lung Screening Trial. Decision tools are needed to help with the management of such pulmonary nodules. We examined whether adding any of three novel functions of nodule volume improves the accuracy of an existing malignancy prediction model of CT scan-detected nodules.
Swensen's 1997 prediction model was used to estimate the probability of malignancy in CT scan-detected nodules identified from a sample of 221 patients at the Medical University of South Carolina between 2006 and 2010. Three multivariate logistic models that included a novel function of nodule volume were used to investigate the added predictive value. Several measures were used to evaluate model classification performance.
With use of a 0.5 cutoff associated with predicted probability, the Swensen model correctly classified 67\% of nodules. The three novel models suggested that the addition of nodule volume enhances the ability to correctly predict malignancy; 83\%, 88\%, and 88\% of subjects were correctly classified as having malignant or benign nodules, with significant net improved reclassification for each (P$<$.0001). All three models also performed well based on Nagelkerke R2, discrimination slope, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration test.
The findings demonstrate that the addition of nodule volume to existing malignancy prediction models increases the proportion of nodules correctly classified. This enhanced tool will help clinicians to risk stratify pulmonary nodules more effectively.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess the sensitivity of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and to estimate the accuracy of MRI for the measurement of lesion size, as compared to computed tomography (CT).
Fifty patients with 113 pulmonary nodules diagnosed by CT underwent lung MRI and CT. MRI studies were performed on 1.5T scanner using the following sequences: T2-TSE, T2-SPIR, T2-STIR, T2-HASTE, T1-VIBE, and T1-out-of-phase. CT and MRI data were analyzed independently by two radiologists.
The overall sensitivity of MRI for the detection of pulmonary nodules was 80.5\% and according to nodule size: 57.1\% for nodules ≤4mm, 75\% for nodules $>$4-6mm, 87.5\% for nodules $>$6-8mm and 100\% for nodules $>$8mm. MRI sequences yielded following sensitivities: 69\% (T1-VIBE), 54.9\% (T2-SPIR), 48.7\% (T2-TSE), 48.7\% (T1-out-of-phase), 45.1\% (T2-STIR), 25.7\% (T2-HASTE), respectively. There was very strong agreement between the maximum diameter of pulmonary nodules measured by CT and MRI (mean difference -0.02 mm; 95\% CI -1.6-1.57 mm; Bland-Altman analysis).
MRI yielded high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary nodules and enabled accurate assessment of their diameter. Therefore it may be considered an alternative to CT for follow-up of some lung lesions. However, due to significant number of false positive diagnoses, it is not ready to replace CT as a tool for lung nodule detection.},

  abstract = {Quantitative computed tomographic (CT) measurement of pulmonary nodules has not been widely applied despite favorable reports. Its usefulness has been questioned by some investigators. A series of experiments on six different scanners was undertaken to study the factors that affect the applicability of this technique. The type of reconstruction algorithm, the design of the CT system, the true slice thickness, and the beam kilovoltage were the most important factors identified. These factors can produce large variations in the CT numbers of pulmonary nodules, preventing direct comparison of results from scanner to scanner. Before undertaking studies of pulmonary nodules, the effect of these variables in each individual scanner should be evaluated. Despite the current lack of standardization, reliable CT number measurements using a specific kilovoltage and slice thickness should be possible on every modern scanner provided it is positionally uniform and gives a linear response to varying densities. We propose that the CT number above which a pulmonary nodule can be considered benign should be the representative CT number of a 1 cm diameter syringe filled with a hydrous calcium chloride solution of 40 mg/ml of water and scanned in air. A better understanding of the physics of lung nodule densitometry is necessary for the proper application of this technique in the management of patients with solitary pulmonary nodules.},

Fifty nodules, less than 20 mm in diameter, in 29 patients were scanned with 1.25-mm collimation using MDCT (time 1 = T1). During the same session, two additional scans, using identical technique, were obtained through each nodule (T2, T3). Three observers working independently then obtained volumetric measurements using a semiautomated volumetric nodule-sizing software package. Qualitative nodule characterization was also performed. The Bland-Altman method for assessing measurement agreement was used to calculate the 95\% limits for agreement for nodule volumes at T1, T2, and T3.
Automated nodule segmentation was successful in 438 (97\%) of 450 measurements. Forty-three nodules were available for final evaluation. Twenty-six nodules had well-defined edges, and 17 had irregular or spiculated margins. Seventeen were freestanding, 16 were juxtapleural, and 10 were juxtavascular in location. Average nodule volume was 345.5 mm(3) (range, 49.3-1,434 mm(3)). The mean interobserver variability (repeatability) was 0.018\% (SD = 0.73\%), and the SD of the mean for the three contemporaneous scans (reproducibility) was 13.1\% (confidence limits, +/- 25.6\%). SD and confidence limits narrowed as volumes increased.
Volumetric measurements show minimal interobserver variability (0.018\%) but an interscan SEM of 13.1\% (confidence limits, +/- 25.6\%). Repeatability and reproducibility of volumetric measurements are better than those of linear measurements reported in the literature.},

Deterministic and random properties of the resulting CT scans have been studied in the literature. Due to the large number of voxels in the three-dimensional (3D) volumetric dataset, full characterization of the noise covariance in MSCT scans is difficult to tackle. However, as usage of such datasets for quantitative disease diagnosis grows, so does the importance of understanding the noise properties because of their effect on the accuracy of the clinical outcome. The goal of this work is to study noise covariance in the helical MSCT volumetric dataset. We explore possible approximations to the noise covariance matrix with reduced degrees of freedom, including voxel-based variance, one-dimensional (1D) correlation, two-dimensional (2D) in-plane correlation and the noise power spectrum (NPS). We further examine the effect of various noise covariance models on the accuracy of a prewhitening matched filter nodule size estimation strategy. Our simulation results suggest that the 1D longitudinal, 2D in-plane and NPS prewhitening approaches can improve the performance of nodule size estimation algorithms. When taking into account computational costs in determining noise characterizations, the NPS model may be the most efficient approximation to the MSCT noise covariance matrix.},

An anthropomorphic phantom was used with a vasculature insert on which synthetic lung nodules were attached. Repeated scans of the phantom were acquired using a 64-slice CT scanner. Overlapping and contiguous reconstructions were performed for a range of CT imaging parameters (exposure, slice thickness, pitch, reconstruction kernel) and a range of nodule characteristics (size, density). Nodule volume was estimated with a previously developed matched-filter algorithm.
Absolute percentage bias across all nodule sizes (n = 2880) was significantly lower when overlapping reconstruction was used, with an absolute percentage bias of 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.4-6.9), compared to 13.2\% (95\% CI, 12.7-13.8) for contiguous reconstruction. Overlapping reconstruction also showed a precision benefit, with a lower standard percentage error of 7.1\% (95\% CI, 6.9-7.2) compared with 15.3\% (95\% CI, 14.9-15.7) for contiguous reconstructions across all nodules. Both effects were more pronounced for the smaller, subcentimeter nodules.
These results support the use of overlapping reconstruction to improve the quantitative assessment of nodule size with CT imaging.},

The largest transverse cross-sectional diameter of each nodule was measured at picture archiving and communication system, or PACS, workstations by using high-spatial-resolution reconstructed CT images and identical window settings. Intra- and interreader agreement were determined by using methods described by Bland and Altman: the coefficient of repeatability for intrareader agreement, and methods derived from the 95\% limits of agreement defined by Bland and Altman for interreader agreement.
The repeatability coefficients were 1.70, 1.32, and 1.51 mm for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 95\% limits of agreement for the difference among readers were -1.73 and 1.73.

This retrospective institutional review board-approved study, with waiver of patient informed consent, included 97 SSNs in 97 patients (45 men, 52 women; median age, 58 years; range, 37-87 years) in whom at least two LD CT scans were obtained, with 3-month or longer follow-up interval and median follow-up of 633 days. SSNs were categorized into pure ground-glass nodules (GGNs) (group A), part-solid GGNs with solid components of 5 mm or smaller (group B), and part-solid GGNs with solid components larger than 5 mm (group C). Three-dimensional manual segmentation for all SSNs was performed on initial and latest follow-up LD CT scans; subsequently, VDTs and MDTs were calculated and were compared among groups by using Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Dunn procedure with Bonferroni correction for volume-growing SSNs and mass-growing SSNs.
Volume growth was thus: 12 of 63 SSNs (19\%), group A; nine of 23 SSNs (39\%), group B; and eight of 11 SSNs (73\%), group C. Median VDT was thus: 1832.3 days (range, 1230.7-4537.3 days), group A; 1228.5 days (range, 934.7-4617.7 days), group B; and 759.0 days (range, 376.4-941.5 days), group C. Mass growth was thus: 17 of 63 SSNs (27\%), group A; 11 of 23 SSNs (48\%), group B; and nine of 11 SSNs (82\%), group C. Median MDT was 1556.1 days (range, 642.5-3564.5 days) for group A, 1199.9 days (range, 838.6-2578.7 days) for group B, and 627.7 days (range, 340.0-921.2 days) for group C. Median VDTs and MDTs of groups A and B were significantly longer than those of group C (P $<$ .01).
Pure GGNs and part-solid GGNs with solid components of 5 mm or smaller show significantly longer VDTs and MDTs than do part-solid GGNs with solid components larger than 5 mm. Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

All of the radiologists had chosen to not include the artefact in the measurements. Significant association between measurement error and the direction of the longest diameter was found for nodules larger than 12 mm, which indicates that, for these nodules, there is a risk of underestimating the nodule size if the in-plane artefact is omitted from manual diameter measurements.},

An evaluation of diameter, area, and volume was performed on 64 different lung lesions by three trained users. These calculations were obtained using a free DICOM viewer and standardized measuring procedures. Measurement variability was then studied using relative standard deviation (RSD) and intraclass correlation. Volumetric measurements were shown to be more precise than diametric. With minimal RSD and variance between different users, volumetric analysis was demonstrated as a reliable measurement technique. Additionally, the diameters were used to calculate an estimated area and volume; thereafter the estimated area and volume were compared against the actual measured values. The results in this study showed independence of the estimated and actual values. Estimated area deviated an average of 43.5\% from the actual measured, and volume deviated 88.03\%. The range of this variance was widely scattered and without trend. These results suggest that diametric measurements cannot be reliably correlated to actual tumor size. Access to appropriate software capable of producing volume measurements has improved drastically and shows great potential in the clinical assessment of tumors.

  abstract = {Objective
Understanding magnitudes of variability when measuring tumor size may be valuable in improving detection of tumor change and thus evaluating tumor response to therapy in clinical trials and care. Our study explored intra- and inter-reader variability of tumor uni-dimensional (1D), bi-dimensional (2D), and volumetric (VOL) measurements using manual and computer-aided methods (CAM) on CT scans reconstructed at different slice intervals.

Materials and methods
Raw CT data from 30 patients enrolled in oncology clinical trials was reconstructed at 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mm slice intervals. 118 lesions in the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes were analyzed. For each lesion, two independent radiologists manually and, separately, using computer software, measured the maximum diameter (1D), maximum perpendicular diameter, and volume (CAM only). One of them blindly repeated the measurements. Intra- and inter-reader variability for the manual method and CAM were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and Bland–Altman method.

Results
For the three slice intervals, the maximum coefficients of variation for manual intra-/inter-reader variability were 6.9\%/9.0\% (1D) and 12.3\%/18.0\% (2D), and for CAM were 5.4\%/9.3\% (1D), 11.3\%/18.8\% (2D) and 9.3\%/18.0\% (VOL). Maximal 95\% reference ranges for the percentage difference in intra-reader measurements for manual 1D and 2D, and CAM VOL were (−15.5\%, 25.8\%), (−27.1\%, 51.6\%), and (−22.3\%, 33.6\%), respectively.

Conclusions
Variability in measuring the diameter and volume of solid tumors, manually and by CAM, is affected by CT slice interval. The 2.5 mm slice interval provides the least measurement variability. Among the three techniques, 2D has the greatest measurement variability compared to 1D and 3D.},
